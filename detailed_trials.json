        "brief_summary": "Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute multi-system vasculitis syndrome of unknown etiology occurring mostly in infants and children younger than 5 years of age. In developed countries, it is the leading cause of acquired heart disease in children. However, KD remains a mysterious disease.~Single high dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG, 2gm/kg) and aspirin are standard treatment for KD. Aspirin have been prescribed in treatment of KD for decade even earlier than usage of IVIG. High dose aspirin mainly act as anti-inflammation, while low dose aspirin as anti-platelet. IVIG may play most of the role of anti-inflammation in acute stage of KD. Hsieh et al. reported that KD without high dose aspirin had the same treatment response after IVIG. Therefore it is still unclear about the necessarily of high dose aspirin in acute stage of KD.~This study was conduct to investigate the role of high dose aspirin in acute stage of KD via a multi-center randomized control trail, and we plan to achieve the followings till year 2017:~Enroll 300 KD patients from multiple medical centers . Randomize group patients as group 1: with high dose aspirin (more than 30/mg/kd/day) until fever subsided and shift to low dose aspirin (3-5mg/kg/day, N=150); and group 2: without high dose aspirin during acute febrile stage, only use low dose aspirin (N=150).~Compare data including fever days, admission duration, laboratory data (CBC/DC, GOT/GPT, BUN/Cr, Alb, ESR, CRP, 2D echo), IVIG treatment response and CAL formation rate (followed at least 1 year)."

        "brief_summary": "Background Kawasaki disease (KD) is characterized by fever, bilateral nonexudative conjunctivitis, erythema of the lips and oral mucosa, changes in the extremities, rash, and cervical lymphadenopathy. Incidence of late coronary artery aneurysms or ectasia, which may lead to myocardial infarction (MI), sudden death, or ischemic heart disease, decreased after the introduction of intravenous immunoglobulin therapy. However, significant persistent coronary arterial lesions or aneurysms may still occur in about 1-3 % of the patients.~Atorvastatin (Lipitor\u00ae), a kind of statin, is a selective competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. This drug had been safely and widely used for treatment of adult hyperlipidemia, prevention of coronary heart disease and familial hypercholesterolemia in childhood. In addition to the cholesterol-lowering effects, statins exerts diverse cellular, cholesterol-independent effects, including improvement in endothelial function, inhibition of neurohormonal activation, and reduction in levels of proinflammatory cytokines. Based on the above concepts, some patients with infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms received statin therapies and then the growth rate of aneurysms slowed down.~Therefore, the investigators may hypothesize that Atorvastatin is helpful in the regression of persistent coronary lesions in KD patients due to its effect of anti-inflammation. In NTUH, there are about 20 KD patients with coronary lesions persistent for many years. And the investigators plan to conduct the clinical trial with atorvastatin to evaluate the effects of Atorvastatin on the persistent coronary arterial lesions/aneurysms in children with Kawasaki disease including safety and efficacy.~Methods~There are around 20 KD patients eligible for this study. After they sign the IRB-approved ICF, they will be enrolled for this study. Briefly, this study is divided into three stages: screening & enrollment stage (I), treatment & follow-up stage (II) for 1 year and final data analysis stage (III). Measurements include basic vital sign, electrocardiography, liver function, muscle enzyme, inflammatory markers and echocardiography.~Predicted results~1.Oral atorvastatin therapy can effectively prevent the progression of coronary lesions in KD patients."
