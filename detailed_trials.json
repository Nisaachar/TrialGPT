        "brief_summary": "Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute multi-system vasculitis syndrome of unknown etiology occurring mostly in infants and children younger than 5 years of age. In developed countries, it is the leading cause of acquired heart disease in children. However, KD remains a mysterious disease.~Single high dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG, 2gm/kg) and aspirin are standard treatment for KD. Aspirin have been prescribed in treatment of KD for decade even earlier than usage of IVIG. High dose aspirin mainly act as anti-inflammation, while low dose aspirin as anti-platelet. IVIG may play most of the role of anti-inflammation in acute stage of KD. Hsieh et al. reported that KD without high dose aspirin had the same treatment response after IVIG. Therefore it is still unclear about the necessarily of high dose aspirin in acute stage of KD.~This study was conduct to investigate the role of high dose aspirin in acute stage of KD via a multi-center randomized control trail, and we plan to achieve the followings till year 2017:~Enroll 300 KD patients from multiple medical centers . Randomize group patients as group 1: with high dose aspirin (more than 30/mg/kd/day) until fever subsided and shift to low dose aspirin (3-5mg/kg/day, N=150); and group 2: without high dose aspirin during acute febrile stage, only use low dose aspirin (N=150).~Compare data including fever days, admission duration, laboratory data (CBC/DC, GOT/GPT, BUN/Cr, Alb, ESR, CRP, 2D echo), IVIG treatment response and CAL formation rate (followed at least 1 year)."

        "brief_summary": "Background Kawasaki disease (KD) is characterized by fever, bilateral nonexudative conjunctivitis, erythema of the lips and oral mucosa, changes in the extremities, rash, and cervical lymphadenopathy. Incidence of late coronary artery aneurysms or ectasia, which may lead to myocardial infarction (MI), sudden death, or ischemic heart disease, decreased after the introduction of intravenous immunoglobulin therapy. However, significant persistent coronary arterial lesions or aneurysms may still occur in about 1-3 % of the patients.~Atorvastatin (Lipitor\u00ae), a kind of statin, is a selective competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. This drug had been safely and widely used for treatment of adult hyperlipidemia, prevention of coronary heart disease and familial hypercholesterolemia in childhood. In addition to the cholesterol-lowering effects, statins exerts diverse cellular, cholesterol-independent effects, including improvement in endothelial function, inhibition of neurohormonal activation, and reduction in levels of proinflammatory cytokines. Based on the above concepts, some patients with infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms received statin therapies and then the growth rate of aneurysms slowed down.~Therefore, the investigators may hypothesize that Atorvastatin is helpful in the regression of persistent coronary lesions in KD patients due to its effect of anti-inflammation. In NTUH, there are about 20 KD patients with coronary lesions persistent for many years. And the investigators plan to conduct the clinical trial with atorvastatin to evaluate the effects of Atorvastatin on the persistent coronary arterial lesions/aneurysms in children with Kawasaki disease including safety and efficacy.~Methods~There are around 20 KD patients eligible for this study. After they sign the IRB-approved ICF, they will be enrolled for this study. Briefly, this study is divided into three stages: screening & enrollment stage (I), treatment & follow-up stage (II) for 1 year and final data analysis stage (III). Measurements include basic vital sign, electrocardiography, liver function, muscle enzyme, inflammatory markers and echocardiography.~Predicted results~1.Oral atorvastatin therapy can effectively prevent the progression of coronary lesions in KD patients."

        "brief_summary": "Kawasaki disease (KD) affects infants and young children causing inflammation of the skin and blood vessels including the coronary arteries of the heart. Despite the currently available therapy, about one third of children develop enlargement of the coronary arteries that can lead to serious complications such as coronary artery stenosis, heart attack and even death.~Kawasaki disease is the most common heart disease in children in the USA and it is especially common among the children of Hawaii. Every year, 50-90 children are diagnosed with KD in Hawaii and unfortunately there is no medication available to successfully prevent coronary artery damage in a subset of cases.~During the first few weeks of the illness, cells of the immune system attack the coronary arteries and release a special substance (MMP) that is responsible for the coronary artery enlargement. There is a common antibiotic, doxycycline that can specifically block the action of this special substance (MMP). Research done on animals with KD showed that doxycycline was able to block this special substance and prevent enlargement of coronary arteries. Research in adults with enlargement of the main artery in their abdomen also showed that doxycycline may improve the outcome. Based on these studies doxycycline may be a promising therapy for children with KD, who develop enlargement of the coronary arteries.~The investigators' proposed research study will assess the usefulness of doxycycline in preventing the progressive enlargement of coronary arteries in children with KD. The investigators plan to perform a small (pilot) study to evaluate how good is doxycycline in preventing coronary artery enlargement. The investigators will treat 50 children with KD and enlarged coronary arteries for three weeks with doxycycline and assess the change in coronary arteries as well as the blood levels of the special substance (MMP). If doxycycline proves to be beneficial in this small study, the investigators are going to design a large research study involving multiple institutions on Hawaii and the mainland and will recruit more children to be certain about the value of the proposed treatment. The investigators' proposal may change the treatment protocol of KD and could present a possible treatment for children with enlarged coronary arteries preventing potentially devastating consequences."

        "brief_summary": "Suriname is a small developing country in South America with a population of half a million people. Early neonatal death in Suriname is high with 16 per 1000 live births. Unpublished data from the Suriname Perinatal and Infant Mortality Survey estimate contribution of infection to early neonatal mortality at 25% (4 per 1000 live births) of all deaths. In comparison, incidence rates of neonatal sepsis alone are 3.5 per 1000 live births. These numbers indicate an increased burden of neonatal infection in Suriname versus the U.S. In any case about 40 newborns that die each year of infection are a huge loss, also considering the small Surinamese community. Despite this overall idea on the impact of infectious disease in Surinamese neonates exact information regarding incidence, type of infection (e.g., localized, viral, early-onset or late-onset sepsis), risk factors (e.g., insufficient antenatal care, maternal Group B-Streptococcus status), etiology, microbial causes, morbidity, antibiotic treatment (type and duration), and epidemiological determinants (e.g., gestational age, sex, ethnicity) are lacking.~From a clinical perspective, there is still a challenge to identify neonates with infection. Neonates are often admitted with ambivalent clinical symptoms and receive preventive antibiotics that are costly, promote pathogen-resistance, and have negative long-term effects (i.e., on the development of the intestinal bacterial flora). Currently, assessment of blood leukocyte or trombocyte counts and levels of CRP are insufficiently sensitive to be used as biomarkers, while confirmation of actual sepsis or meningitis by positive culture results is relatively rare (0.5-3% in the United States). This complicates decisions on duration of antibiotic treatment and hospitalization significantly, while no other biomarkers exist.~The circulating isoforms of adhesion molecules (cAMs), which mediate interactions of leukocytes with the vascular endothelium, have been proposed as biomarkers for infection and sepsis. During infection they accumulate in the bloodstream as a result of shedding, which represents their removal from cell surfaces of endothelial cells and leukocytes by enzymes called sheddases. Recently, we have reviewed mechanisms behind shedding of cAMs in neonatal, pediatric and adult sepsis. The shedding process reflects a critical and active process in orchestrating interaction between leukocytes and the endothelium for an effective host response, while minimizing collateral tissue damage. As a result, both plasma levels of cAMs and their sheddases are subject to change during infection and sepsis. Additionally, compelling, albeit limited, data suggest changes of levels of cAMs in CSF in adult and pediatric meningitis.~To date, some evidence exists of changes in levels of cAMs during malaria (in children from Malawi) and sepsis, although not sensitive enough to predict outcomes in the clinic. Those levels have never been assessed simultaneously with levels of their sheddases in blood or CSF as a diagnostic tool. We propose that this combined approach may provide more detailed information about the extent of inflammatory activation in neonates.While a balance in levels is maintained under resting conditions or mild (local) infection, it may be perturbed during sepsis or meningitis . Thus, simultaneous measurement of these levels could promote early identification of infection, and may even distinguish between mild infection, systemic infection or meningitis. Currently, manufacturers are rapidly developing Luminex\u00ae technology as an advanced, fast, high-throughput and clinically feasible bedside tool for such an approach.~We hypothesize that incidence rates of neonates with infection in Suriname are high. We further hypothesize that, upon signs of infection, the simultaneous measurement of cAMs and their SEs in serum and CSF discriminates between infected and non-infected neonates. We aim to: 1) identify and follow neonates at the Academic Hospital Paramaribo with signs of infection to establish incidence rates of infection, and 2) investigate diagnostic potential of our proposed biomarker combination in these neonates for infection, type of infection (e.g., local (mild), sepsis or meningitis) and outcomes."

        "brief_summary": "The present study is intended to evaluate the safety and tolerability of topical OC-10X Ophthalmic Suspension in healthy human subjects. OcuCure Therapeutics, Inc. (Roanoke, VA) has developed a lead compound, known as OC-10X, which is a selective tubulin inhibitor under development for the treatment of Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (PDR) and Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD). When administered as a topical eye drop, OC-10X has demonstrated both anti-angiogenic (inhibition) and angiolytic (regression) properties in animal models of AMD. Unlike other therapies, OC-10X provides the efficacy of a vascular targeting agent without the traditional toxicity and works downstream independently of growth factors. As demonstrated by OcuCure's preclinical data, tubulin inhibition using OC-10X has promise as a new therapeutic approach. PDR is a major cause of blindness in adults and is also caused by the growth of abnormal blood vessels. These new blood vessels are fragile and may hemorrhage into the vitreous. PDR affects up to 80% of all diabetics who have had diabetes for 15 years or more. If administration of OC-10X is well tolerated as a topical eye drop and is well tolerated systemically, then OC-10X will have the potential to provide benefits to patients with ocular diseases associated with angiogenesis."

        "brief_summary": "Osteoarticular infections are painful and disabling diseases that require antimicrobial treatment adapted to the microorganisms implicated. Microbiological cultures are currently regarded as the reference for identification of pathogenic bacteria. However, the sensitivity of these cultures is very variable and depends both on the context in which clinical samples are taken, and on the pathogen involved. The rate of detection varies according to infection type: from 50 to 70% for infectious spondylodiscitis, 65 to 95% for prosthetic joint infections, 50% for gonococcal arthritis and 90% for non-gonococcal arthritis. The aim of the study is to evaluate the diagnostic performances of microbiological cultures and molecular methods in case of osteoarticular infections. The gold standard will be established by an expert group of osteoarticular infection (composed by a bacteriologist, a radiologist, a surgeon, an anatomy-pathologist and a rheumatologist), which established the final diagnosis of infected or not infected patients."

        "brief_summary": "This phase II trial studies how well giving cyclophosphamide and anti-thymocyte globulin together followed by peripheral blood stem cell transplant (PBSCT) and mycophenolate mofetil works in treating patients with systemic scleroderma (SSc). Stem cells are collected from the patient's blood and stored prior to treatment. To store the stem cells patients are given colony-stimulating factors, such as filgrastim (G-CSF) or chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide) to help stem cells move from the bone marrow to the blood so they can be collected and stored. After storage, patients are then given high-dose chemotherapy, cyclophosphamide, and immunosuppression with anti-thymocyte globulin to suppress the immune system to prepare for the transplant. The stem cells are then returned to the patient to replace the blood-forming cells that were destroyed by the chemotherapy and immunosuppression. After the stem cells have engrafted and have matured enough to support the immune system at approximately 2-3 months, patients are given a medication called mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or Myfortic. This medication is given to prevent worsening or reactivation of SSc and is referred to as maintenance therapy."

        "brief_summary": "This study will test the safety of an experimental vaccine for preventing West Nile virus infection. The virus is spread mainly by mosquito bites. Symptoms can include high fever, headache, neck stiffness, stupor, muscle weakness, vision loss, numbness and paralysis. Rarely, infection leads to permanent nerve damage and possibly death. The vaccine used in the study is made from DNA that codes for West Nile virus proteins. Injected into a muscle, the DNA instructs the body to make a small amount of West Nile virus protein. This study will see if the body creates resistance or immunity to these proteins. Participants cannot get West Nile virus from the vaccine.~Healthy normal volunteers between 18 and 65 years of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history, physical examination, and blood and urine tests for various infections and other medical problems. Women who are able to become pregnant are given a pregnancy test. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding may not participate. Anyone who has received a vaccination for Yellow Fever or Japanese Encephalitis virus in the past may not participate in this research study.~Participants will receive three injections of the experimental vaccine, the first on the first study day (Day 0), the second on Day 28, and the third on Day 56. The injections are given with a device called Biojector\u00ae (Registered Trademark) 2000 that delivers the vaccine through the skin into the muscle without the use of a needle. On the day of each injection, subjects are given a diary card to take home for recording their temperature and any symptoms or side effects for 5 days. They return to the clinic 2 weeks after each injection, bringing the completed card with them at that time. In addition to the injections, subjects have the following tests and procedures during clinic visits:~Medical history and, if needed, physical examination: Day 0 and weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24 and 32~Vital signs and weight: Day 0 and weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24 and 32~Lymph node exam: Day 0 and weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12~Blood samples: Day 0 and weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24 and 32~Pregnancy test (for women): Day 0 and weeks 4, 8 and 32~Urine sample: Day 0 and weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10~The blood and urine tests are for health checks. Some blood samples are also used to study the immune response to the vaccine and for gene testing."

        "brief_summary": "Esophageal cancer is one of the common malignant disease, especially in China. The annual incidence of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma is 260,000 with the motility of 210,000. The prognosis of esophageal cancer is very poor. About 50% of patients have advanced disease at diagnosis and the natural course is only 6-8 months with a 5-year survival rate of 5-7%. Though some patients received surgical treatment, disease will recurrent and metastasis in nearly 90% of the patients.~In past decades, there isn't much improvement of the outcome and survival of advanced esophageal cancer due to the lack of effective chemotherapy agents. The traditional chemotherapy drugs include 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin and the combination of them results in a 25-35% response rate in both first-line and palliative treatment. Paclitaxel plus cisplatin regiment is another promising treatment of esophageal cancer and have been proved effective in many studies. One of our previous study showed paclitaxel and cisplatin treatment resulted in encouraging response rate with manageable side-effects in 131 patients of advanced esophageal cancer.~However, the toxicities of paclitaxel and cisplatin limit their combination in clinic. For example, the polyoxyethylene castor oil paclitaxel could induce acute hypersensitivity reactions and neurotoxicity. Cisplatin could result in dysfunction of kidney and neurotoxicity. In addition, most of esophageal cancer patients are age 65 to 70. Many of them have simultaneously other diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease which cause varying damages of renal function and limit the use of cisplatin in these patients. Therefore, it is urgent for doctors to seek an alternative of cisplatin in the combination chemotherapy treatment.~Therefore, the investigators designed this randomized clinical trial in which a novel combination of S-1 with paclitaxel is used to treat advanced esophageal cancer patients in compare with paclitaxel/cisplatin and 5-FU/cisplatin treatment to explore its efficacy and toxicity. The investigators hope this study will provide some clues for the treatment of esophageal cancer patients."

        "brief_summary": "Objectives: 1) To determine risk factors for fetomaternal hemorrhage. 2) To identify a cost-effective method to detect fetomaternal hemorrhage prior to significant fetal anemia.~Significance/Background: Fetomaternal hemorrhage (FMH) is a condition in which occurs when the placenta transfers blood from the fetus to the mother. Normally, nutrition and gasses pass from mother to baby through the placenta and only waste products pass from baby to mother through the placenta. Whole blood cells do not normally cross the placenta in significant amounts. Mild FMH, where a small amount of whole blood passes from fetus to mother but does not hurt the mother or baby, occurs in about 75% of pregnancies. A pregnant woman does not know this occurs. It is only discovered if a special blood test that is labor-intensive to perform and difficult to interpret called the Kleihauer-Betke acid elution test is done. As mild FMH hurts no one, this test is not part of routine care. In most cases, testing is done only if a baby is born sick with unexplained anemia. Severe FMH, which can cause the baby to become sick from anemia (low red blood cell count) is caused by large blood loss into the mother, occurs in only 1-3 per 1000 births. Severe anemia caused by FMH can result in death of the baby before or after birth, or significant illness in the newborn period. Short term problems for the baby include difficulty breathing, difficulty maintaining blood pressure, and difficulty providing oxygen to all parts of the body. This can cause multiple problems with the function of internal organs including the liver, kidneys, intestines, and brain. Babies who become sick from severe FMH can develop long-term problems including cerebral palsy (a lifelong problem with body movements) and/or mental retardation.~It is not known why some pregnancies are affected by FMH and others are not. It is thought that FMH may occur more frequently now than in the past, but no one knows why. If identified early, FMH is readily treatable by blood transfusion of the baby before or after birth and/or early delivery. Current laboratory testing for FMH is difficult and expensive. There is great need identify high risk patients early in pregnancy in order to treat the condition before the baby gets sick.~Approach: Five hundred women will be asked to participate in the study at the time they are admitted to the Mount Sinai labor floor for delivery at term. After birth, newborns of study mothers will be tested for anemia. Mothers of anemic babies will donate blood for confirmation of FMH by established laboratory methods as well as for development of a new laboratory screening protocol. All mothers will provide medical, social, environmental, and full pregnancy history. Risk factors for FMH will be identified by statistical analysis of this information."

Volunteers will have study visits at baseline, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 7 months, and 12 months where they will be asked about any medical problems that have come up since the last study visit, have vital signs taken, review current medication use, and review any signs of potential adverse events. Blood and urine samples will also be collected at these visits, as well as throat and stool samples.~Our goal is to assess the safety and tolerability of LGG when administered to healthy adult volunteers twice a day. Assessment of safety will be determined by vital sign measurements, physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests, and from the incidence and severity of adverse events that occur during study participation. Additionally, we will assess whether LGG colonizes the throat and/or gastrointestinal tract of healthy adult volunteers and assess the effect of LGG on the bacteria that normally live in the throat and GI tract by using culture-independent techniques. Volunteers enrolled in this study will also be invited to participate in a companion genetic study that will investigate the host immune response to the bacteria in LGG."

The Lake Louise Consensus Group defined acute mountain sickness as the presence of headache in an unacclimatized person who has recently arrived at an altitude above 2,500 m plus the presence of one or more of the following: gastrointestinal symptoms (anorexia, nausea, or vomiting), insomnia, dizziness, and lassitude or fatigue. An increase in RBC mass is a natural feature of altitude acclimatization. Hypoxia-induced erythropoietin (EPO) secretion begins hours after ascent and stimulates bone marrow production of red blood cells, but this takes weeks to effect an increase in red cell mass . Therefore, it is feasible that EPO therapy weeks before altitude exposure decrease high altitude illness.~In 1996, Young et al in U.S. Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine (USARIEM) reported that autologous erythrocyte infusion did not ameliorate the decrement in maximal oxygen uptake at 4,300m altitude despite increasing arterial oxygen carrying capacity. On the basis of this report, USARIEM did not recommend use of recombinant EPO for altitude acclimatization.~However, increases in erythrocyte count, hematocrit and hemoglobin associated with EPO therapy have been shown to decrease fatigue and increase work capacity and exercise tolerance. In addition, improvement in CNS function and cognitive ability has been noted with EPO therapy. Subjective benefits include improvement in sleep habits, tolerance to cold; decreased dyspnea, anginal symptoms and tachycardia and improved appetite, all of which are symptoms associated with high altitude illness.~The investigators also reported improved muscle energy metabolism with EPO in dialysis patients, but not with RBC transfusion.~In this study, the investigators will conduct a randomised controlled trial to assess the effect of EPO administration on AMS at an altitude of 4,130 m."

Subjects need not have both clinical features and biochemical markers of disease to be enrolled. However, both clinical and laboratory responses will be evaluated in each subject for improvement as outcome measures (even improvement of laboratory values found to be within the normal range at baseline). \n\n NOMID, MWS, and FCAS: Diagnosis will be based on the history of classical features of disease including fevers, rash, joint involvement, CNS involvement. Approximately half of all subjects with these clinical syndromes are mutation negative; however, in the experience of the principal investigator these subjects show favorable clinical response to IL-1 blockade with anakinra. Therefore, subjects with or without recognized mutations in CIAS1 will be eligible to enroll in this study. Active disease will be defined as either the presence of aforementioned classical features, or a history of such features that became quiescent in the setting of therapy with anakinra. However, before a patient who has quiescent disease and is currently taking anakinra can receive study drug, he/she must fulfill criteria for active disease after anakinra has been discontinued. \n\n FMF will be diagnosed on the basis of documented presence of one or two mutant alleles of MEFV as well as the history of classical clinical features of FMF such as periodic fevers, rash, arthritis, arthralgia, or episodes of serositis. Subjects must be considered non-responsive to colchicine (up to 2 milligrams per day) on the basis of continued symptoms or flares (greater than or equal to one per month) or elevated acute phase reactants (ESR, CRP or SAA greater than or equal to 1.5 times the upper limit of normal between attacks) despite treatment with maximally tolerated doses of colchicine. Positive genetic test will be required for FMF to rule out the possibility that non-response to colchicine is due to misdiagnosis. \n\n Adult Still's disease will be diagnosed on the basis of history of classical clinical features such as fevers, evanescent salmon-pink rash, arthritis, arthralgia, and myalgia. Active disease will be defined as presence of one or more of these features and/ or elevation of acute phase reactants (ESR, CRP or SAA greater than or equal to 1.5 times the upper limit of normal). \n\n Subjects currently treated with anakinra may be enrolled in this study even though autoinflammatory disease may be quiescent. For these subjects a history of active autoinflammatory disease prior to treatment with anakinra will be sufficient. Subjects must be greater than 48 hours from their last dose of anakinra before beginning IL-1 Trap therapy, and will not take anakinra for the remainder of their enrollment in the study. However, before study drug is administered subjects have to manifest signs of active disease as described above \n\n Stable dose of steroids, NSAIDs, DMARDs, or colchicine for four weeks prior to enrollment visit. \n\n Females of childbearing potential (young women who have had at least one menstrual period regardless of age) must have a negative urine pregnancy test at screening and a negative serum pregnancy test at baseline prior to performance of any radiologic procedure or administration of study medication. \n\n Women of childbearing age and men able to father a child, who are sexually active, who agree to use a form of effective birth control, including abstinence. \n\n Negative PPD test using 5 T.U. intradermal testing per CDC guidelines, and no evidence of active TB on chest X-ray. Subjects with latent TB (positive PPD test) currently treated with adequate therapy initiated for at least one month prior to first dose of study medication may be included. Full prophylaxis regimens will be completed. Subjects who have been BCG-vaccinated will also be skin-tested. \n\n Able to understand, and complete study-related questionnaires. \n\n Able and willing to give informed consent and abide with the study procedures. \n\n ",
        "exclusion_criteria": ": \n\n Treatment with a live virus vaccine during 3 months prior to baseline visit. No live vaccines will be allowed throughout the course of this study. \n\n Current treatment with TNF inhibitors or recent discontinuation of TNF inhibitors (use within less than 5 half-lives of TNF inhibitor agent). \n\n Presence of active infections or a history of pulmonary TB infection with or without documented adequate therapy. Subjects with current active TB, or recent close exposure to an individual with active TB are excluded from the study. \n\n Chest x-ray read by a radiologist with pleural scarring and/or calcified granuloma consistent with prior TB. \n\n Positive test for or prior history of HIV, Hepatitis B or C. \n\n History or concomitant diagnosis of congestive heart failure. \n\n History of malignancy. Subjects deemed cured of superficial malignancies such as cutaneous basal or squamous cell carcinomas, or in situ cervical cancer may be enrolled. \n\n Known hypersensitivity to CHO cell derived biologicals or any components of IL 1 Trap. \n\n Presence of any additional rheumatic disease or significant systemic disease. For example, major chronic infectious/ inflammatory/ immunologic disease (such as inflammatory bowel disease, psoriatic arthritis, spondyloarthropathy, SLE in addition to autoinflammatory disease). \n\n Presence of any of the following laboratory abnormalities at enrollment visit: creatinine greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal, WBC less than 3.6 x 10(9)/mm(3); platelet count less than 150,000 mm(3); ALT or AST greater than 2.0 x ULN (ALT/AST greater than 2.0 x ULN in an adult Still's disease patient would prompt a hepatology consult prior to enrollment unless these abnormalities are considered by the Principal Investigator to be reflective of the underlying Still's disease). \n\n Lactating females or pregnant females. \n\n Subjects with asthma not adequately controlled on current therapy. \n\n Enrollment in any other investigational treatment study or use of an investigational agent, or has not yet completed at least 4 weeks or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer, since ending another investigational device or drug trial. \n\n Subjects for whom there is concern about compliance with the protocol procedures. \n\n Presence of other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition, or significant laboratory abnormality requiring further investigation that may cause undue risk for the subject's safety, inhibit protocol participation, or interfere with interpretation of study results, and in the judgment of the investigator would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this study.",
        "brief_summary": "Autoinflammatory diseases are illnesses characterized by episodes of inflammation that, unlike autoimmune disorders, lack the production of high titer autoantibodies or antigen-specific T cells. There is growing genetic and clinical evidence that Interleukin-1 (IL-1) plays a pathogenic role in several of these diseases. This exploratory study aims to examine the utility of the experimental drug candidate, IL 1 Trap (Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) in the treatment of adult subjects with the autoinflammatory disorders Neonatal Onset Multisystem Inflammatory Disease (NOMID), Muckle-Wells Syndrome (MWS), and Familial Cold Autoinflammatory Syndrome (FCAS), Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF), and adult Still's disease. FMF is associated with mutations in pyrin encoding MEFV. NOMID, MWS and FCAS are associated with mutations in cryopyrin-encoding CIAS1.~This pilot study is designed to address: 1) the utility of IL 1 Trap in the treatment of subjects with diseases known to respond to IL-1 blockade (NOMID/MWS/FCAS) as shown by response to treatment with anakinra [Kineret]; 2) the response to IL-1 blockade of subjects with Adult Still's disease and colchicine-resistant FMF once the efficacy of IL-1 Trap has been established in NOMID/MWS/FCAS subjects; and 3) the biochemistry and genetics of autoinflammatory diseases and IL-1 related inflammation.~IL-1 Trap is a recombinant fusion protein with picomolar affinity for IL-1 and a half-life of approximately 7.5 days in humans. This agent is currently in Phase 2 clinical studies for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and initial studies have shown activity against clinical and biochemical indicators of inflammation. Compared with anakinra, this agent may exhibit improved dosing convenience, potential for fewer injection site reactions, and improved efficacy due to the extremely high affinity of IL-1Trap for its target.~In this study, biochemical, genetic, and clinical correlates of autoinflammatory disease will initially be measured at baseline following a withdrawal of any TNF or IL-1 inhibitor medications where applicable. Subjects will receive a course of therapy with IL-1 Trap that is predicted to provide an estimated 3-4 weeks of anti-inflammatory activity. Clinical, biochemical, and genetic correlates of inflammation will be measured at appropriate intervals to ascertain response and to further elucidate disease mechanisms. Subjects will be eligible, based on clinical response, to enter a 1- year extension phase with IL-1 Trap. Those subjects who complete the 1-year extension phase, and maintain improved clinical and laboratory parameters compared to baseline values, may continue to receive study medication at their current dose until the study drug is commercially available.~Investigator comment:~This protocol (from the NIH standpoint) is a continuation of the ongoing protocol 05-AR-0014, with a new change in study sponsor, the NIH replacing Regeneron as sponsor. this protocol therefore still contains background and procedural information that refer to patients with FMF and FCAS and or MWS and Still's disease, however only patients with Still's disease will be newly enrolled from this point on, enrollment for the FCAS and or MWS patients has already been completed and it has been decided to not enroll any more FMF patients because the number of subjects is too low to reach reasonable conclusions, in addition it has been difficult to recruit patients that are eligible. The background section and study procedures have largely been left as in the currently IRB approved protocol."

The primary endpoint was all cause death or admission for heart failure. Additional prespecified outcomes included all-cause death, cardiovascular death, all-cause admission, heart failure admission. Secondary cardiovascular outcomes included the changes from baseline to the last available observation after treatment in NYHA functional class, quality-of-life scores, LVEF, LVEDD, mitral regurgitation and wall-motion score index assessed by ECG. Adverse events were reported during in-hospital observation and follow-ups."

Ebola virus infection may range from mild to severe, and may cause breathing problems, severe bleeding, kidney problems and shock that can lead to death. The vaccine used in this study contains man-made genetic material similar to one part of the Ebola virus, which is designed to stimulate an immune response to the virus. The vaccine itself cannot cause Ebola virus infection because it does not contain any Ebola virus.~Participants are assigned to one of three groups as they enter into the study. Of the first 16 people in the study, 12 receive the lowest study dose of vaccine and 4 receive placebo (an inactive substance). If this dose is safe, then of the next 16 people who enter the study, 12 receive a higher dose of the vaccine, and the remaining 4 receive placebo. If this dose is safe, the final 12 people in the last group of 16 receive the highest study dose, and 4 receive placebo. The vaccine is given as a single injection in the arm on the day of enrollment.~Participants keep a diary for 5 days, recording their temperature, symptoms and any reaction at the injection site. They call a study nurse the day after vaccination to report how they feel, and they return to the clinic approximately six times for follow-up evaluations. These visits may include a check of vital signs, physical examination, blood and urine tests, or other medical tests if needed.~..."

        "brief_summary": "Iron deficiency (ID) with or without anaemia (IDA) is a major public health problem worldwide, especially in women of reproductive age and young children. Iron supplementation is an effective strategy to prevent and treat ID and IDA. There is a lack of data on iron bioavailability from different supplementation regimens and how to optimize bioavailability in a cost-effective and patient-friendly way. The daily supplementation with 1-4 mg Fe/kg body weight for 3 months is reported to be the most effective method to rapidly increase iron stores in subjects with ID and IDA. In IDA patients, medical practitioners often prescribe supplementation regimens with 120 mg iron per day split into 2 doses with 60 mg iron, arguing that the splitting would increase iron bioavailability compared with one single high dose. However, there is no scientific evidence for this assumption; to the contrary, results from a recent study suggest that iron bioavailability from a second supplementation dose of iron after a first supplementation dose of iron is impaired due to increased hepcidin levels. To address this bioavailability issue, the present study will determine iron absorption from 120 mg iron administered for 3 consecutive days and compare it with that from 2 doses of 60 mg iron per day administered for 3 consecutive days. The investigators hypothesize that the iron bioavailability from the single daily dose will be lower than that from the 2 doses. By measuring also hepcidin, this study will provide important insights on the iron bioavailability from a single dose of iron and on the same amount iron split into two doses (b.i.d. administration)."

Two factors have been found to contribute to a higher teenage driving accident rate than adults: lack of driving experience, and risky behaviors. Insufficient driving experience puts teenagers at a disadvantage in detecting and responding to hazards while driving. Factors contributing to distracted driving (a diversion in the driver's attention from the road) may include: talking or text messaging on a cell phone, applying makeup, having multiple passengers, listening to loud music, eating/drinking, smoking or reading while driving.~This is a prospective study designed to evaluate the effect of an educational program on the risks associated with distracted driving for teenage drivers. The researchers will compare cell phone usage behaviors in Pennsylvania, where no cell phone laws are in place, and New Jersey, where cell phone laws exist, and will educate the beginner driver on the potential dangers associated with driving without a seat belt, substance use, and participating in distracting driving behaviors. Knowledge of state laws will also be assessed.~Objectives~Educate participants on the potential dangers of distracted driving.~Evaluate the impact of the educational program on teenage distracted driving behaviors by obtaining and analyzing information from student surveys, state law quizzes, and anonymous observation, pre, post, and delayed post education.~Quantify distracted driving behavior in teenage driver's attending local area high schools by obtaining and analyzing information from student surveys, state law quizzes, and anonymous observation, pre, post, and delayed post education.~Qualify distracted driving behavior in teenage driver's attending local area high schools by obtaining and analyzing information from student surveys, anonymous observation, and anonymous voicemails, text messages, and/or emails pre, post, and delayed post education.~Qualify distracted driving behavior in adults through anonymous observations near local area high schools.~6. Compare teenage driving behaviors as reported and observed between Pennsylvania and New Jersey.~7.

        "brief_summary": "Background. Carotid artery stenting (CAS) recently has become an accepted method for treatment of patients with high-grade carotid artery stenosis, who are at an increased risk for surgical carotid endarterectomy (CEA). The reported rates of neurological complications of CAS substantially decreased during the past years, and the routine use of cerebral protection devices and low profile catheter systems have further increased the procedure\u00b4s safety. In the early 90's large surgical trials in North America and Europe (NASCET, ECST and ACAS) demonstrated superiority of CEA compared to best medical treatment for symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Provided that the ongoing randomized controlled trials comparing CAS and CEA confirm equivalence between the these methods, CAS similar to CEA is applicable to symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with high grade carotid stenosis. However, particularly in asymptomatic patients, the indication for revascularisation remains debatable. Protected CAS is associated with a very low rate of neurological complications, which are below the AHA recommendation for treating asymptomatic patients (3%). However, the introduction of new vascular protective medications like statins and clopidogrel during the recent years substantially improved the spectrum of best medical treatment, and the findings of NASCET, ECST and ACAS with respect to best medical treatment may therefore not be applicable any more.~Study hypothesis and aims. Given the low frequency of spontaneous neurological complications, the preferable therapeutic approach to patients with asymptomatic high grade ( > 80%) carotid artery stenoses is currently unknown. Modern best medical treatment may manage to stabilize the atherosclerotic plaque, while CAS has the potential of resolving the carotid stenosis. Comparative data, however, are not available as yet. We hypothesized that protected CAS has a beneficial effect on occurrence of ipsilateral neurological complications and major adverse cardiac events in high-risk patients with asymptomatic > 80% internal carotid artery stenosis. Therefore, the aim of the present randomized controlled trial was to analyze neurological and cardiovascular outcome of patients treated with elective CAS plus best medical treatment compared to best medical treatment only."

        "brief_summary": "Background:~Lyme disease is an infection caused by Borrelia burgdorferi, a bacteria that is transmitted to humans by ticks. It can cause many different symptoms including rash, fever, headache, meningitis (infection of the central nervous system), and arthritis. While most patients improve after taking antibiotics, some patients continue to have symptoms. It is currently unknown why some patients continue to have symptoms. One possibility is that the antibiotics have not successfully gotten rid of all of the bacteria. Current tests for Lyme disease cannot tell whether the bacteria have been successfully eliminated from the body.~Xenodiagnosis is a way to look for Borrelia bacteria using the animal that usually hosts them, Ixodes scapularis (also known as the deer tick). This method takes advantage of the evolution of the bacteria and the insect that transmits the infection, which can make the insect particularly good at finding the agent. In studies of animals, xenodiagnosis may be more sensitive than current tests for detecting the presence of the Lyme disease bacteria. Researchers are interested in using xenodiagnosis to determine whether uninfected ticks that feed on humans who have been infected with Lyme disease bacteria can detect the continued presence of live bacteria.~Objectives:~- To determine whether xenodiagnosis can be used to successfully investigate the presence of Lyme disease bacteria.~Eligibility:~Individuals at least 18 years of age who are in one of the following categories:~Have had the erythema migrans rash (a symptom of Lyme infection) and received antibiotic therapy less than 4 months ago (but have not had antibiotics in the previous month).~Have the erythema migrans rash and received less than 2 days of antibiotic therapy.~Have been diagnosed with early or late Lyme disease, have received antibiotic therapy, but still have high levels of antibodies against the bacteria at least 6 months after therapy, and have not received antibiotics in the past 3 months.~Have been diagnosed with early or late Lyme disease, have received antibiotic therapy, and have new complaints of fatigue or other symptoms that are persistent for at least 6 months after completion of antibiotic therapy, and have not received antibiotics in the past 3 months.~Have been diagnosed with Lyme arthritis and have not yet received antibiotic therapy.~Healthy volunteers who have not had Lyme disease will also be included in this study.~Design:~Participants will have an initial visit for a physical examination, medical history, and blood sample.~For the first study visit, researchers will place a strip of filter paper or a small plastic container with 20 to 30 disease-free ticks on the participant s skin. If possible, the ticks will be placed at the site of a Lyme disease rash or another suspicious area, or on the nondominant forearm. Participants will be asked to keep the ticks in place, and will keep a diary card at home to record any symptoms or problems.~The ticks will be collected 4 to 6 days after placement. At that visit, participants will have a skin biopsy taken of the area tested, a blood sample will be collected, and participants will receive a new diary card to keep until the next clinic visit.~After 1 month, participants will provide a final blood sample, and will receive a follow-up phone call 2 months afterward."

Alternatively, blood samples may be required for research tests to ascertain that the CMV-specific T-cells do not contain any cells that could react against the patient. These patients will sign a separate pre-treatment consent. If it is determined that a patient will qualify for and might benefit from infusions of CMV CTLs, he/she will go on to sign the standard treatment consent for MSKCC IRB # 05-065 and be enrolled and treated on trial, if all other eligibility criteria are met. \n\n Each patient must satisfy at least one of the following criteria: \n\n The patient must have a clinically documented condition associated with CMV (e.g. interstitial pneumonia, hepatitis, retinitis) or \n\n The patient must have microbiological evidence of CMV viremia or tissue invasion as attested by viral culture, or detection of CMV antigenemia or detection of levels of CMV DNA in blood or body fluids consistent with CMV infection. \n\n The patient's CMV infection is clinically progressing or CMV viremia is persistent or increasing (as evidenced by quantitation of CMV antigenemia or CMV DNA in the blood) despite two weeks induction therapy with antiviral drugs. \n\n The patient has developed CMV viremia as attested by viral culture, or detection of CMV antigenemia or detection of levels of CMV DNA in blood or body fluids while receiving prophylactic doses of antiviral drugs to prevent CMV infection post transplant. or \n\n the patient is unable to sustain treatment with antiviral drugs due to drug associated toxicities (e.g. myelosuppression [ANC < 1000 ul/ml without GCSF support] or nephrotoxicity [corrected creatinine clearance < than or equal to 60ml/min/1.73m2 or creatinine >2 mg/dl]). \n\n Because CMV infections are life-threatening and may involve the lungs, liver, gastrointestinal tract, hematopoietic and central nervous systems, and antiviral drugs may also compromise renal and hematopoietic function, dysfunctions of these organs will not affect eligibility for this protocol. \n\n However, to be eligible, the patients should meet the following clinical criteria: \n\n They must have a stable blood pressure and circulation, not requiring pressor support. \n\n They should have adequate cardiac function as demonstrated by EKG and/or by echocardiographic evidence. \n\n They should have a life expectancy, even if they require respirator support, of at least 3 weeks. \n\n They are no age restrictions to eligibility for this protocol. \n\n ",

Normal donors will be evaluated for evidence of prior sensitization to CMV by CMV serology. They will also be typed for HLA A, B, C and DR. For allogeneic hematopoietic progenitor cell transplant (HSCT) recipients, the marrow transplant donor will constitute the donor of choice, since those T-cells will grow and persist in a patient who has already engrafted with a transplant from that donor. However, if the HSCT donor is CMV seronegative or not available (e.g. a cord blood transplant or an unrelated donor who has not already donated T-cells for adoptive therapy), CMV-specific T-cells generated from a seropositive donor matched for at least 2 HLA alleles shared by the patient may be used. \n\n Normal donors fulfilling these criteria who consent to donate blood for the generation of CMV-specific T-cells for adoptive therapeutic purposes will receive a detailed clinical evaluation, including a medical history, physical examination, and serologic testing for transmissible diseases within 1 week of donation including hepBs Ag and hepatitis C antibody, HIV-1 and 2, HTLV-1 and 2, CMV (only if previously negative), VDRL, WNV, and Chagas An HIV+ donor will be rejected on medical grounds. Donors must have Hgb value > 10 gm/dl and must be capable of undergoing a single 3-6 unit leukapheresis (preferable) or a single unit of blood for T cells (for pediatric donors, no more than 5 ml/kg at any one blood draw). \n\n A prospective donor will be informed of the purposes of this study, and its requirements. If he/she consents, the donor will be requested to provide two blood samples: \n\n i. An initial donation of 25ml blood anticoagulated with heparin or ACD. This blood is used to establish a B cell line transformed with the B95.8 laboratory strain of EBV. This EBV+ B cell line/ (EBVBLCL) will be used as an antigen-presenting cell. When loaded with the pool of CMVpp65 pentadecapeptides, the EBVBLCL efficiently sensitize T cells from the same donors against CMV as well as EBV. \n\n Because the establishment and testing of an EBV transformed B cell line suitable for use or as an antigen-presenting cell require 4-5 weeks of in vitro culture, it is important that this sample be obtained as early as possible for patients at risk for a CMV infection. Because patients receiving HSCT from unrelated or HLA disparate donors are particularly at risk for severe CMV infections in the first 2-3 months after transplant, this blood sample should be obtained from the donor prior to donation of the hematopoietic progenitor cell transplant whenever possible. \n\n ii. A donation of either a single standard 2 blood volume leukapheresis collected in standard ACD anticoagulant. If it is impossible to collect a leukapheresis from some of the donors, a unit of whole blood will be acceptable. However, the AICTF (Adoptive Immune Cell Therapy Facility manufacturing the clinical grade cell products under GMP conditions in MSKCC) may only be able to generate a limited number of T cells from a unit of blood. This blood is required for isolation of the T cells to be sensitized with the pool of CMVpp65 15-mers loaded on the autologous EBVBLCL, and propagated in vitro. In addition, it is required to provide autologous feeder cells essential to sustain T-cell growth without the risk of stimulating the growth of alloreactive T-cells capable of inducing GVHD. \n\n This donation of a leukapheresis or a unit of blood will be obtained from unrelated HSCT donors at least 2 weeks after their donation of an HSCT, or as soon as possible thereafter. \n\n In order to limit the number of blood or leukapheresis donations that would be required of any donor, each donor will be informed of the following potential applications of the blood cells donated. The white cells contained in one leukapheresis are sufficient to grow enough T- cells to treat the three conditions below in a transplant patient: \n\n The use of cells to generate CMV-specific T-cells for potential use in the treatment of the patient for whom the donor has provided an HSCT, under MSKCC IRB # 05-065. \n\n The use of a fraction of the cells isolated to generate: \n\n immune T-cells specific for another virus, such as Epstein-Barr virus, that can cause lethal lymphomas in transplant recipients, and \n\n immune T-cells specific for a protein called WT-1, that is differentially expressed by malignant blood cells. \n\n Such T-cells could be used, under separate protocols, to treat EBV associated diseases (IRB 95-024) and/or to treat or prevent leukemia recurrence (07-055) in the patient receiving the donor's hematopoietic progenitor cell transplant. \n\n The donation of the immune T-cells generated from the donor that are not used for or required by the patient for whom they were originally intended to a bank of immune cells that will be stored and maintained cryopreserved under GMP conditions in the Adoptive Immune Cell Therapy Facility at MSKCC, These stored T-cells , may be used for the treatment of other patients with CMV or EBV infections/malignancies that express HLA alleles shared by the donor. \n\n In addition to these prospectively accrued donors, we have, since the initiation of this protocol, generated over 100 CMV-specific T-cells for patients at high risk for infection, of which far fewer patients have required treatment. Since these patients are now beyond the period of risk for CMV infection, their donors will be approached with a separate consent to allow for the use of their T cells in recipients other than the primary patients for whom they initially donated cells.",
        "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to test the safety of a transfusion of specialized white cells from your transplant donor's blood, called T-cells, that have been grown and immunized against the CMV virus in the test tube. If the transplant donor is immune to CMV (ie: the donor has antibody to CMV in the blood), the T-cells will be selected and grown from the blood of the transplant donor. However, if the transplant donor is not immune to CMV, or if T-cells from the donor are not readily available, CMV-immune T-cells grown from the blood of another normal donor who is partially matched to the patients tissue type can be used. The transplant physician will explain which of these treatments is available to the patient.~This trial is called a phase I trial because phase I trials are designed to test the safety of different doses of an experimental treatment. We want to find out what effects, good and/or bad, a dose/doses of these immune T-cells will have on the patient and on the CMV infection.~Specifically, we wish to test CMV immune T-cells grown from your blood using a new method developed at our center. In this method, fragments of an important CMV protein, called CMVpp65, are chemically synthesized and then used to immunize T-cells in the test tube."

        "inclusion_criteria": "inclusion criteria: \n\n Patients may be enrolled in the study only if they meet all of the following criteria: \n\n Diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke with onset between 3 and 24 hours prior to planned start of study drugs. Acute ischemic stroke is defined as a measurable neurological deficit of sudden onset, presumed secondary to focal cerebral ischemia, and not otherwise attributable to ICH or another disease process. Stroke onset will be defined as the time the patient was last known to be without the new clinical deficit. Patients whose deficits have worsened in the last 24 hours are not eligible if their first symptoms started more than 24 hours before. If the stroke started during sleep, stroke onset will be recorded as the time the patient was last known to be intact. A careful history is important to determine when the patient was last without the presenting deficits. \n\n Disabling neurological deficit attributable to the acute stroke at the start of study drugs. \n\n NIHSS less than or equal to 16. \n\n Evidence on PWI MRI of a perfusion defect corresponding to the acute stroke syndrome of at least 2cm in diameter in both long and short axis in any slice. The PWI will be assessed by relative mean transit time (MTT) images. The MRI evaluation must involve echo planar diffusion weighted imaging, MRA, and MRI perfusion. A normal appearing MRA with an appropriate perfusion defect is eligible. An apparent stenosis or occlusion on MRA with normal appearing perfusion distally will not be eligible. Poor quality or uninterpretable MRA will not make patient ineligible. Patients who have a normal DWI are eligible. \n\n Age 18 - 80 years, inclusive. \n\n ",

        "brief_summary": "This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of two types of blood thinners, abciximab (ReoPro) and reteplase (Retavase) for restoring normal brain blood flow after ischemic stroke (stroke resulting from a blood clot in the brain).~The only therapy approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat ischemic stroke is the clot buster drug rt-PA. This treatment, however, is effective only if begun within 3 hours of onset of the stroke and most patients do not get to the hospital early enough to benefit from it. There is thus a pressing need to develop effective stroke treatments that can be initiated more than 3 hours after onset.~Patients between 18 and 80 years of age who have experienced a mild or moderate acute stroke between 3 and 24 hours before starting study drugs may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a physical examination, blood tests and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan (if an MRI was not done during the stroke evaluation).~All participants will receive ReoPro. Some will also receive Retavase, which may boost the effectiveness of ReoPro. Retavase is administered in a single dose through a needle in the vein over 2 minutes. ReoPro is infused into the vein over 12 hours. Patients will be monitored with physical examinations, blood tests, computed tomography (CT) scans, and three or four MRI scans of the brain to evaluate both the response to treatment and side effects of the drugs. An MRI scan will be done 24 hours, 5 days and 30 days after starting the study medication, and possibly during screening for this study.~CT involves the use of specialized x-rays to obtain images of the brain. The patient lies still in the scanner for a short time while the X-ray images are formed. MRI uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to demonstrate structural and chemical changes in tissue. MRI is more sensitive than x-ray in evaluating acute stroke. The patient lies on a table in a metal cylinder (the scanner) while the pictures are being taken. During part of the MRI, a medicine called gadolinium contrast is injected in a vein. This medicine brightens the images, creating better pictures of the blood flow."

        "brief_summary": "This study will evaluate the safety and immune response of children to an experimental malaria vaccine called AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel\u00ae (Registered Trademark) + CPG 7909. Malaria is an infection of red blood cells caused by a parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, that is spread by certain kinds of mosquitoes. It affects at least 300 million people worldwide each year, with more than 1 million deaths, mostly among children less than 5 years of age in sub-Saharan Africa. Malaria is the leading cause of death and illness among the general population of Mali in West Africa. Increasing drug resistance to P. falciparum and widespread resistance of mosquitoes to pesticides are reducing the ability to control the disease through these strategies. AMA1 C1 is made from a synthetic protein similar to a P. falciparum protein. It is combined with Alhydrogel and CPG 7909, substances added to vaccines to make them work better.~Children between 1 and 4 years of age who live in Bancoumana, Mali, and are in general good health may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history, physical examination, and blood and urine tests.~Participants are randomly assigned to receive three injections (shots) of either AMA1-C1 or a control rabies inactivated vaccine called Imovax\u00ae (Registered Trademark). The shots are given in the thigh muscle on study days 0, 56 and 180. After each shot, participants are observed in the clinic for 30 minutes. They return to the clinic for a physical examination six or seven times between each shot and then four more times over a 9-month period after the last shot. Blood samples are drawn at several of these visits to check for side effects of the vaccine and to measure the response to it. The total duration of the study is 21 months.~..."

        "brief_summary": "Acute Bacterial Rhinosinusitis (ABRS) is a respiratory inflammation commonly seen in clinical practice, which has with respiratory symptoms including nasal congestion, rhinorrhoea, postnasal discharge and cough and is associated with headache, cheek pain, facial pressure and other conditions. The principal bacterial pathogens in causing ABRS include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis. These three bacteria account for approximately 90% of ABRS in children less than or equal to 5 years of age. Combination of Potassium Clavulanate (CVA) and Amoxicillin (AMPC) produces higher antibiotic activity against beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. The present study is designed to assess the clinical efficacy, bacteriological efficacy and safety of CVA/AMPC (1:14) administered in children aged from 3 months to less than 15 years with ABRS. It is an open-label study consisting of a 7-day treatment phase and a post-treatment follow-up phase for 7 to 14 days."
