The note mentions that the patient will provide informed consent and comply with the trial protocol without any practical issues, but there is no mention of her having such responsibilities.\n\nFor criterion 2, the patient has a diagnosis of Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome or daytime hypercapnia. However, this criterion requires evidence of active device treatment of OSA other than PAP therapy, which is not mentioned in the note.\n\nFor criterion 3, the patient does not have any previous or planned upper airway surgery for sleep apnea or major ear, nose or throat surgery. The note mentions that the patient leads a sedentary lifestyle but is a non-smoker, and there is no mention of such surgery.\n\nFor criterion 4, the patient does not have diagnosis of Central or Mixed Sleep Apnea with % of mixed or central apneas/hypopneas \u226550%, or diagnosis of Cheyne Stokes Respiration. The note mentions that the patient wants to reduce her obesity, but there is no direct evidence of these conditions.\n\nFor criterion 5, the patient does not have a self-reported change in body weight >5 kg within 3 months prior to screening. The note mentions that the patient has a BMI of 30, classified as overweight, but this is not considered a self-reported change in body weight.\n\nFor criterion 6, the patient does not have a prior or planned surgical treatment for obesity (excluding liposuction, abdominoplasty or cryolipolysis if performed more than 1 year prior to screening). The note mentions that the patient wants to reduce her obesity, but there is no mention of such surgery.\n\nFor criterion 7, the patient does not have a prior or planned endoscopic and/or present device-based therapy for obesity. The note mentions that the patient leads a sedentary lifestyle but is a non-smoker, and there is no mention of such therapy.\n\nFor criterion 8, the patient does not have obesity induced by other endocrinologic disorders or diagnosed monogenetic or syndromic forms of obesity. There is no direct evidence in the note to support this claim.\n\nFor criterion 9, the patient has personal or job-related responsibilities that would make it unsafe to stop PAP therapy for 7 days prior to PSG testing during the study. The note mentions that the patient will provide informed consent and comply with the trial protocol without any practical issues, but there is no mention of such responsibilities.\n\nFor criterion 10, the patient is unwilling to temporary discontinue PAP therapy for 7 days prior to PSG testing during the study. The note mentions that the patient will provide informed consent and comply with the trial protocol without any practical issues, which implies that she is willing to follow the protocol."
