However, the patient note does not provide any information about the patient's phosphorylated tau (P-tau) result, which is a specific inclusion criterion for the trial. Furthermore, the patient's severe cognitive deficits could be interpreted as dementia, which is an exclusion criterion for the trial.",

There is not enough information to determine the patient's eligibility for the inclusion criteria, as the patient note does not mention the patient's P-tau result or any current medications for Alzheimer's Disease.",
