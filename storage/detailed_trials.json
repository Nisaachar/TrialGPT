Each enrolled participant in Part A will receive a single dose of LY3954068 or placebo (no active drug) given into the spinal fluid. If conducted, each participant in Part B would receive 2 doses of either LY3954068 or placebo administered into the spinal fluid.\n\nThe study will last up to approximately 45 weeks for Part A, and, if conducted, 73 weeks for Part B, including the screening period.\n\nIf the optional bridging period is conducted, participants in Part A could be enrolled in the separate potential study for up to approximately 96 weeks, including the screening period.",
