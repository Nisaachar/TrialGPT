Participants will receive exenatide for 16 weeks and placebo for 16 weeks with a 3 week rest period in between. Neither participants nor investigators will know whether exenatide or placebo is being administered. Participants will be started randomly on either exenatide or placebo.\n\nOur hypothesis is that treatment with exenatide will curb appetite and lead to weight loss and may lead to changes in energy expenditure.",
