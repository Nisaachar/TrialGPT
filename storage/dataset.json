Patients are randomized to receive either adjuvant gemcitabine immediately after radical operation (treatment arm A) or no treatment (control arm B). Patients in the control arm are to be treated with gemcitabine as soon as tumor progression becomes evident clinically and/or radiologically.\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\nThe secondary objectives of this study are:\n\n* Estimation of time-specific survival probabilities irrespective of causes of death.\n* Assessment of toxicity and tolerability of gemcitabine\n* Description of survival experience of patients in the control arm beyond the time of initiating chemotherapy.\n* Assessment of quality of life (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer \\[EORTC\\] Quality of Life Questionnaire \\[QLQ\\]-C30).\n\nStudy Design:\n\nThis is an open-label, prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled phase 3 two-arm study using gemcitabine as a single agent in chemonaive cystectomy patients with locally advanced TCC of the bladder in an adjuvant setting. The patients will receive the following treatment:\n\nArm A (treatment): gemcitabine 1250 mg/m2 intravenously once a week for 2 weeks (days 1 and 8) followed by 1-week rest period. Repeat cycle on day 22. Maximum of 6 cycles. Begin treatment until 3 months after radical operation (within first 6 weeks is recommended).\n\nArm B (control): No immediate post-surgery treatment. Watchful waiting; treatment only conditionally in case of progression with gemcitabine (dose and schedule as in arm A).",

Recent data have suggested that exenatide could improve LV function by an inotropic effect in patients suffering from cardiogenic shock or from congestive heart failure. Moreover, patients suffering from congestive heart failure reported a better quality of life when they were treated with exenatide compared to placebo.\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that perioperative exenatide infusion could improve postoperative quality of life in CABG surgery patients.",

Sertraline is a medication that is widely used to treat MDD and is a known substrate of cytochrome P450s (CYP450s), including CYP450 2D6 (CYP2D6), CYP450 2C19 (CYP2C19), CYPP450 3A4 (CYP3A4), and a modest inhibitor of CYP2D6. Based on the diversity of hepatic metabolic clearance pathways for LY2216684 and its elimination by the kidney, it is expected that CYP2D6 inhibition by sertraline will not result in a substantial change in the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of LY2216684. LY2216684 is only known to be a moderate inhibitor of CYP2C19, so it is unlikely that coadministration of sertraline with LY2216684 will result in a clinically meaningful change in the PK of sertraline. This study is being conducted to test these hypotheses.",

How to improve the treatment outcome of these patients is a very important issue and requires further clinical investigation.\n\nThe major aim of this project is to conduct a prospective, randomized phase III clinical trial to examine if cervical cancer patients treated by radiotherapy with cisplatin and gemcitabine have better survival rates than those treated by radiotherapy with cisplatin alone.\n\nGemcitabine has been demonstrated to be a good radiosensitizer. In keeping with this, few clinical trials in early phases showed promising results when using concurrent radiotherapy with cisplatin and gemcitabine. According to these positive results, the investigators expect this trial has the potential to improve the survival in patients with advanced cervical cancer, reduce the medical costs due to tumor relapse, and then benefit the whole society.",

It has been shown to possess unique features such as low cost, fast-acting, short half-life, safe metabolites, and causing excellent muscle relaxation for intubation. It has many side effects as well. Postoperative myalgia (POM), with an incidence rate of \\~41%-92%, is one of the most common side effects of this drug and can take several days to cause significant discomfort in patients. However, its effect is felt more in the throat, neck, shoulder, and abdominal muscles and is common among patients with outpatient surgery. Due to its unknown real context of pathogenesis and in an effort to reduce the incidence and severity of succinylcholine-induced myalgia, various medications including nondepolarizing muscle relaxants, benzodiazepines, magnesium sulfate, opioids, gabapentin, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been tested, with varying degrees of success.\n\nDuloxetine is an US Food and Drug Administration-approved analgesic used for various pain syndromes, including diabetic peripheral neuropathy and fibromyalgia. The underlying mechanism for duloxetine against these pain syndromes remains unclear, but it may involve three major central nervous system (CNS) targets: (1) serotonin transporter (Ki, 4.6 nM), (2) norepinephrine transporter (Ki, 16 nM), and (3) dopamine transporter (Ki, 370 nM). In the past, the antidepressant action was often thought to be the primary mechanism for its analgesic efficacy. This theory was addressed later by \"Path Analysis,\" and the result showed that duloxetine affects pain directly rather than indirectly through mood improvement. In addition to these multiple CNS targets, duloxetine, like the antidepressant amitriptyline and the local anesthetic bupivacaine, blocks voltage-gated Na+ channels. Because neuronal Na+ channels are present in both CNS and peripheral nervous systems, such a finding expands the possible analgesic action and locus of duloxetine.",

The purpose of this study is to find out whether a medicine called empagliflozin helps to lower the chances of having to go to the hospital for heart failure and whether it lowers the chances of dying from cardiovascular disease.\n\nPeople who are in hospital may join the study soon after being treated for their heart attack. Participants are put into 2 groups by chance. One group takes 1 empagliflozin tablet a day. The other group takes 1 placebo tablet a day. Placebo tablets look like empagliflozin tablets but do not contain any medicine. All participants continue their standard treatment. Empagliflozin belongs to a class of medicines known as SGLT-2 inhibitors. Empagliflozin is a medicine that helps people with type 2 diabetes to lower their blood sugar. Researchers think that empagliflozin might also help people after heart attack who are at risk for heart failure, whether or not they have diabetes.\n\nParticipants are in the study for about 1 to 2 years. During this time, there are about 4 visits inperson, 2 visits are done either by phone or by use of an mobile application. Results between the empagliflozin and placebo groups are compared.

This study will evaluate the potential association between atomoxetine and cerebrovascular events. In this study, the incidence of selected cerebrovascular outcomes as represented in health claims data among adult patients who initiate therapy with atomoxetine will be estimated. In particular the study will focus on cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and transient ischemic attack (TIA) as the outcomes of interest. The incidence for each outcome among atomoxetine initiators will then be compared to the incidence in a cohort of similar patients who initiate stimulant treatment and an age and gender-matched general population cohort. The atomoxetine and stimulant-initiating cohorts will be matched on a broad variety of variables, including age, gender, diagnoses, medication use, and healthcare utilization through the use of propensity score matching in order to minimize the influence of confounding by indication. The analysis will include the cohorts (atomoxetine and stimulant initiators) from a previous completed study with increased follow-up time (1 January 2003 through 30 June 2007) and accrue new atomoxetine and stimulant ADHD medication initiators over a 2 year period, so that the study will represent initiators between January 1, 2003 and December 31, 2006 with follow-up through June 30, 2007.",

Secondary objectives included: 1) estimation of the percentage of completely resected NSCLC tumors that can be adequately analyzed and used to direct specific adjuvant chemotherapy; 2) estimation of the proportion of patients who are assigned to treatment with vinorelbine and pemetrexed; 3) evaluation of drug sensitivity patterns of cisplatin and pemetrexed in both treatment arms; 4) description of the overall median survival experience of treated patients; and 5) assessment of patient understanding and perceptions of participating in a clinical trial evaluating cancer genomics for adjuvant treatment of early stage lung cancer.",

        "brief_summary": "This study is for patients with a type of cancer called carcinoma of unknown primary site (CUP), meaning that the site of the body where the tumor has originated is not clear. Currently, carcinoma of unknown primary site (CUP) accounts for about 5% of all newly diagnosed malignancies. The stage of the tumor is such that it is not treatable by surgery. Currently, the standard treatment for such a type of cancer at that stage is chemotherapy. However, the overall prognosis for patients with metastatic CUP remains poor, even if treated with conventional chemotherapy. Through ongoing research at medical centers around the world, doctors are trying to improve on the presently available chemotherapy regimens. The purpose of the investigators' study is similar: it is trying to determine whether a combination of three chemotherapy drugs - carboplatin, gemcitabine, and capecitabine - will improve the treatment of patients with metastatic CUP. The reason the investigators are interested in the above combination of chemotherapy agents is that each one of them is already used in patients with a variety of specific tumors, such as lung cancer, breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, colon cancer, etc.\n\nThis research study will help determine whether the combination of carboplatin, gemcitabine and capecitabine can be used and is effective in patients with carcinoma of unknown primary site.",

Vinorelbine mimics RANPB2 silencing in BRAF-like and BRAFV600E CC cell lines.\n\nThese preclinical data represent a strong rationale to also explore the anti-tumor activity of vinorelbine in patients with advanced BRAF-like (both BRAFm and BRAF wild type) CC. Tumors having this gene signature are referred to as \"BRAF-like\" and have a similar poor prognosis irrespective of the presence of BRAF(V600E) mutation.

Gemcitabine is an excellent choice for combination therapy by its unique mechanism of action and favourable toxicity profile. The combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin was shown to be effective in several trials, producing response rates of 30-52 % in patients with pretreated metastatic breast cancer. To improve on tolerability and handling of the regime carboplatin may be the more appropriate choice for treatment. The mechanism of action of carboplatin is very similar to that of cisplatin. The rational for combining gemcitabine and carboplatin is based on their single-agent activities in metastatic breast cancer, the activity of this combination in other malignancies and on the fact that carboplatin has demonstrated efficacy comparable with cisplatin in several tumor types.",

Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Cetuximab may also make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Giving pemetrexed disodium, carboplatin, and radiation therapy together with cetuximab may kill more tumor cells.\n\nPURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how well giving pemetrexed disodium and carboplatin together with radiation therapy with or without cetuximab works in treating patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer that cannot be removed by surgery.",

Part II is designed to obtain proof of principle of the LY3200882 plus capecitabine combination in patients with chemo-resistant CRC. The combination of LY3200882 plus capecitabine will be given as second line therapy in the phase II part of this study.\n\nPatients with chemotherapy resistant activated TGF-\u03b2 signature-like tumors will have received a fluoropyrimidine (5FU or capecitabine) in the first line of chemotherapy, usually combined with oxaliplatin and, depending upon local hospital preferences or national guidelines, also bevacizumab, or cetuximab/panitumumab if the tumor is KRAS wild type. Addition of LY3200882 to capecitabine should thus result in reversal of unresponsiveness, which is the first step in exploring this concept in the clinic. Capecitabine can be used as single agent in advanced CRC and is thus attractive for this study concept. If proof of principle is achieved also other tumor types can be explored with this genetic makeup, such as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in second line of treatment after platinum doublet therapy in first line, usually cisplatin/carboplatin-pemetrexed in non-squamous and cisplatin/carboplatin-gemcitabine or cisplatin/carboplatin-paclitaxel in squamous type NSCLC.",

        "lillyAlias": [],
        "brief_summary": "In patients with type 2 diabetes, the incretin effect is markedly reduced contributing to the relative insulin deficiency that characterizes these patients. This defect is believed to be due to a decreased effect of GLP-1 and an almost ceased effect of GIP. Nevertheless, the impact of the defect on glucose tolerance is not fully understood. The so-called gastrointestinal-mediated glucose disposal (GIGD) is a measure of glucose handling, which includes the incretin effect, but also other factors affecting glucose disposal (e.g. glucagon secretion). Interestingly, patients with type 2 diabetes exhibit elevated plasma glucagon levels in the fasting state, and glucagon concentrations fail to decrease appropriately and may even increase in response to ingestion of glucose and show exaggerated increases after a mixed meal. With the current project the investigators wish to elucidate how this paradoxical glucagon response observed in patients with type 2 diabetes affects the GIGD, the incretin effect and postprandial glucose excursions.\n\nTen patients with type 2 diabetes and 10 healthy matched control subjects will be enrolled in this randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blinded study. The aim is to examine the effect of a glucagon receptor antagonist (GRA) on gastrointestinal-mediated glucose disposal (GIGD), incretin effect and postprandial glucose excursions in patients with type 2 diabetes and healthy controls. Participants will attend two oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT), two isoglycaemic iv glucose infusion (IIGI) and two standardised liquid meals.",

We will also measure the effects on various markers of endothelial function, subclinical inflammation, fibrinolysis, and oxidative stress. The control group for the study will receive Lantus insulin, with a goal of similar glycemic control between the treatment and control groups.\n\nSpecific Aims\n\nWe will test the following hypotheses:\n\n1. Treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes who are inadequately controlled by monotherapy with a Sulfonylurea (SU) or Metformin, or on combination therapy of a SU and Metformin with Exenatide (GLP-1 mimetic) will result in improved endothelial dependent vasodilation, as measured by FMD, as compared to the control group, who will be treated with Lantus insulin to achieve comparable HbA1c levels.\n2. Treatment with Exenatide (GLP-1 mimetic) will result in improved arterial stiffness, as measured by AI by PWA, as compared to the control group, who will be treated with Lantus insulin to achieve comparable HbA1c levels.\n3. Endothelial dependent vasodilation, as measured by FMD, and arterial stiffness, as measured by AI, measured in the postprandial state (following a standard test meal) will be improved following treatment with Exenatide as compared to treatment with once daily basal insulin (Lantus).\n4. Treatment will result in no improvement in endothelial-independent vasodilation, as measured by a response to TNG, as compared to the control group, who will be treated with Lantus insulin to achieve comparable HbA1c levels.\n5. Treatment with Exenatide, compared with treatment with Lantus, will result in a reduction in various plasma markers of inflammation (CRP, TNFA, IL6), endothelial activation (ICAM, VCAM, endothelin 1), fibrinolysis (PAI-1 protein, PAI-1 activity), and oxidative stress (FOX2).",

Eligible patients have an advanced solid tumor, multiple myeloma or B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma for which standard treatment options are no longer available and acceptable performance status and organ function. A genomic or protein expression test must have been performed on the tumor and the results must identify at least one potentially actionable molecular variant as defined in the protocol. Results from the molecular profiling test will be used to determine an appropriate drug(s) from among those available in the protocol. The choice of drug will be supported by a list of potential profiles, a molecular tumor board, a knowledge library and by study coordinators for review and approval of the match. The protocol-specified treatment will be administered to the patient once any drug-specific eligibility criteria are confirmed and a fresh pre-treatment biopsy is performed for future genetic studies. All patients who receive treatment with a drug available in the protocol will be followed for standard efficacy outcomes including tumor response, progression-free and overall survival as well as duration of treatment.

This program, entitled Community Acquired Pneumonia \\& Sepsis Outcome Diagnostics (CAPSOD), is a multidisciplinary collaboration involving investigators at six organizations: NCGR; Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC; Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit, MI; Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN; Indiana Centers for Applied Protein Sciences, Indianapolis, IN; and ProSanos Corp., La Jolla, CA.\n\nIn the United States, Community Acquired Pneumonia is the sixth leading cause of death and the number one cause of death from infectious diseases. Of the 5.6 million annual cases of CAP, 1.1 million require hospitalization for intensive therapy. Sepsis, commonly known as blood poisoning or bloodstream infection, is the tenth leading cause of death in the US and the number one cause of death in non-cardiac intensive care units. Incidence of sepsis is increasing by 9% each year and mortality rates vary between 25 and 50%. Cost to the US healthcare system exceeds $20 billion each year.\n\nIn patients with suspected sepsis or early CAP, rapid identification of patients who will develop severe sepsis or CAP is critical for effective management and positive outcome. The CAPSOD study is designed to identify novel tests for early diagnosis of severe sepsis and CAP. When performed in patients at the earliest stages of disease, these tests will have prognostic value, rapidly identifying those who will have poor outcomes or complicated courses.\n\nCAPSOD will prospectively enroll patients with sepsis and CAP at Duke University Medical Center and Henry Ford Hospital. The study will use advanced bioinformatic, metabolomic, proteomic and mRNA sequencing technologies to identify specific protein changes, or biomarkers, in patient blood samples that predict outcome in sepsis and CAP. Development of biomarker-based tests will permit patient selection for appropriate disposition, such as the intensive care unit, and use of intensive medical therapies, thereby reducing mortality and increasing effectiveness of resource allocation.",

The objective of Part A is to investigate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of the fixed dose combination (FDC) of empagliflozin 10 mg / linagliptin 5 mg compared with empagliflozin 10 mg plus FDC matching placebo administered orally once daily for 24 weeks in Japanese patients with T2DM (Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus) who have insufficient glycaemic control after 16 weeks of treatment with empagliflozin 10 mg alone once daily. The study is designed to show superiority of the FDC of empagliflozin 10 mg / linagliptin 5 mg over empagliflozin 10 mg plus FDC matching placebo after 24 weeks of treatment. The objective of Part B is to investigate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of the FDC of empagliflozin 25 mg / linagliptin 5 mg compared with empagliflozin 25 mg plus FDC matching placebo administered orally once daily for 24 weeks in Japanese patients with T2DM who have insufficient glycaemic control after 16 weeks of treatment with empagliflozin 25 mg alone once daily. The study is designed to show superiority of the FDC of empagliflozin 25 mg / linagliptin 5 mg over empagliflozin 25 mg plus FDC matching placebo after 24 weeks of treatment.

This could help prevent disease progression to more serious symptoms and complications, and spread of COVID-19 in the community.\n\nThis study looks at the safety and effectiveness of different drugs in treating COVID-19 in outpatients. In Phase II, participants in the study will be treated with either a study drug or with placebo. In protocol version 7.0, participants in Phase III of the study will be treated with either a study drug or active comparator drug. Participants assigned to the bamlanivimab agent/placebo arm and will have 28 days of intensive follow-up following study drug administration, followed by limited follow-up through 24 weeks in phase II and in phase III.

        "brief_summary": "Patients with diabetes are characterised not only by compromised insulin secretion and action, but also by elevated plasma levels of the 29-amino acid peptide hormone glucagon, which hitherto has been considered a pancreas-derived hormone (produced in and secreted from alpha cells in the islets of Langerhans). In patients with diabetes, circulating glucagon concentrations are elevated in the fasting state and fail to decrease appropriately or even increase in response to an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) or after ingestion of a mixed meal. Hyperglucagonaemia is known to be a potent stimulator of hepatic glucose output, and, thus, contributes significantly to the fasting and postprandial hyperglycaemia characterising patients with diabetes. Despite intense research over the years the mechanisms behind the elevated glucagon levels in diabetes is still not clear. Recently, the investigators showed that totally pancreatectomised patients also show a hyperglucagonaemic response during OGTT, a finding that suggests that the pancreas is not the only source of glucagon production in man.\n\nIn the present project, the investigators wish to evaluate the impact of gastrointestinally derived glucagon secretion observed in totally pancreatectomised patients on postprandial glucose tolerance.\n\nThe investigators hypothesise that antagonisation of glucagon signalling (from gastrointestinally derived glucagon) in totally pancreatectomised patients will improve or perhaps normalise the patients glucose tolerance during a 75g-OGTT. In order to test this hypothesis, the investigators wish to apply the potent and selective oral antagonist of the human glucagon receptor LY2409021 and placebo, respectively.\n\nThe study is a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, cross-over study.\n\n10 healthy persons and 10 pancreatectomized patients (i.e. patients who have had their pancreata removed due to pancreatic cancer or severe chronic pancreatitis) will be subjected to two experimental days with LY2409021 and placebo, respectively, on which they will undergo an OGTT followed by a fasting period and finished off with an ad libitum meal.",

The main systemic treatment options for these women include endocrine therapy (ET). The need of over-coming de novo or acquired resistance to ET in metastatic breast cancer has led to the integration of CDK4/6 inhibitors into combined ET of MBC. Abemaciclib represents a selective and potent small molecule inhibitor of CDK4/6 which has been granted approval by the European Medical Association (EMA). In two phase III trials Abemaciclib has been shown to double treatment efficacy in terms of PFS prolongation, to improve ORR and to prolong overall survival. At the same time, it has been shown that side effects of the drug are well manageable and QoL of patients under Abemaciclib is maintained.",

        "brief_summary": "Background: Multiple studies have found Atomoxetine (Strattera) to be efficacious but there is only one published study specifically designed to evaluate its efficacy in school settings. In this 7 week placebo-controlled study, Atomoxetine (ATX) at mean dose of 1.3 mg/kg, significantly reduced teacher rated ADHD symptoms (Weiss et al., 2005). However, children are typically referred for treatment because of \"real life\" problems in functioning, not symptoms (Pelham, Fabiano, \\& Massetti, 2005). While ATX has been found to produce functional improvements at home, the Weiss study found limited results in this area at school.\n\nFurthermore, almost no research has examined the effects of combining ATX and behavior therapy (BT). In the MTA, adding BT to stimulants improved teacher ratings of hyperactivity/impulsivity and increased the number of subjects reaching optimal response (Swanson et al., 2001). Therefore, it is possible that the addition of BT to ATX may improve functional performance in the classroom. The effects of combined therapy may be even larger for ATX as monotherapy with nonstimulants produces smaller effect sizes than with stimulants.\n\nObjective: The primary objective was to evaluate the effects of ATX alone and in combination with BT on the school functioning of 56 children ages 6-12 with ADHD. Outcomes were assessed using traditional symptoms measures as well as functional measures of academic and behavioral improvements in the classroom.",

Therefore, the proposed study aims to characterize patients with T2DM in the UK initiating empagliflozin in terms of baseline characteristics, concomitant medications, and comorbidities compared to patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) initiating other SGLT-2 inhibitors or other non-insulin GLDs. Due to the mode of action, some patients taking empagliflozin have experienced weight loss in clinical trials.

Investigators will prospectively enroll eligible consented patients with diabetes who are receiving corticosteroids as part of their treatment in a large county hospital, will randomize them to intervention or control groups, and will monitor their glucose levels during their inpatient stay.

Nowadays, GDM is recognized as an entity with long-term serious sequels to the mother (GDM is considered a forerunner of type 2 diabetes) and her offspring. Indeed, according to the programming hypothesis, GDM sets the stage for metabolic syndrome, obesity, type 2 diabetes and hypertension. However, these cross-sectional studies failed to control for maternal disease history and genetic background although heredity is a major epidemiology risk factor of type 2 diabetes. Also, studies usually refer to traditional markers such as BMI, blood pressure, lipids profile and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT); none explored inflammatory biomarkers and adipokines in-depth, despite the possible link between their presence and the development of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases in GDM offsprings.\n\nExclusion of genetic confounding factors will help establish the role of GDM as an independent marker of cardiometabolic risk in GDM offspring. It is highly relevant to identify GDM as a risk factor for cardiometabolic diseases, given the worldwide obesity epidemic, the alarming prevalence increase of GDM and its serious sequels to both mother and offspring.",

Clinical observations suggest that baricitinib can reduce or halt hair shedding within 4-6 weeks, offering a faster response than conventional treatments like systemic corticosteroids. This 16-week, single-center, open-label study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of baricitinib in 30 patients with acute AA and active shedding. Participants will receive 4 mg daily for 16 weeks, with responders tapering to 2 mg for an additional 16 weeks. Follow-up visits will occur at weeks 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 36, 44, and 52.

Our hypothesis is based on the assump\u00action of dual impairment of the somatosensory system in these patients. Hypalgesia to phasic experimental pain may be due to diminished spinal and brainstem transmission. Hyperalgesia may be at\u00actributed to increased interoceptive perception (somatic complaints, especially those consist\u00acing in pain) due to sensitisation or lack of inhibition of the interceptive perception. These ef\u00acfects seem to be mediated by specific brain regions (e.g. the right insula). The investigators intent to test if duloxetine effects on these somatic complaints, especially pain complaints are due to a nor\u00acmalization of these interceptive alterations which have been reported to be associated with depressive symptoms. The investigators hypothesize that treatment with duloxetine will normalize \"patho\u00aclogical\" activation patterns (as assessed by fMRI) associated with increased interoceptive perception.",

        "brief_summary": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a fatal degenerative disease of the brain for which there is no cure. AD causes brain cells to die. AD is thought to be caused by an excess of beta-amyloid (\u03b2-amyloid), a sticky protein in the brain that forms amyloid plaques. At autopsy, AD patients are required to have these amyloid plaques in the brain in order to have a definitive diagnosis of AD. Inhibiting the enzyme gamma-secretase (\u03b3-secretase) lowers the production of \u03b2-amyloid. Semagacestat (LY450139) is a functional \u03b3-secretase inhibitor and was shown to lower \u03b2-amyloid in blood and spinal fluid in humans tested thus far and in blood, spinal fluid, and brain in animals tested thus far. This study used several different tests to measure the effect of semagacestat on both \u03b2-amyloid and amyloid plaques for some participants. The build-up of amyloid plaques was measured by a brain scan that takes a picture of amyloid plaques in the brain. Other tests measured the overall function of the brain and brain size in some participants. In this trial, participants who initially received placebo (inactive sugar pill) were, at a certain point in the study, switched over to active drug, semagacestat. In other words, all participants could eventually receive active drug. Participation could last approximately 2 years. Participants taking approved AD medications were permitted to participate in this study and continue taking these medications during the study. All participants who completed this study had the option to continue receiving semagacestat by participating in an open-label study.\n\nPreliminary results from this study (H6L-MC-LFAN \\[LFAN\\]) and another similar study (H6L-MC-LFBC \\[LFBC; NCT00762411\\]) showed semagacestat did not slow disease progression and was associated with worsening of clinical measures of cognition and the ability to perform activities of daily living. Study drug was stopped in all studies. Studies LFAN, LFBC, and open-label H6L-MC-LFBF (LFBF; NCT01035138) were amended to continue collecting safety data, including cognitive scores, for at least 7 months. The Clinical Trial Registry (CTR) will reflect results of analyses from the original LFAN protocol in addition to those from the amended LFAN protocol.",

Neither the subjects nor the clinicians will know whether the subject is receiving FORTEO or placebo.\n\nPatients will undergo routine periodontal treatment procedures including periodontal surgery. Starting from 3 days prior to surgery, all subjects will self-administer FORTEO or placebo for 6 weeks. Subjects will be trained for self-administration, a procedure similar to diabetic injections. Patients will also take Vitamin D and Calcium by mouth during this time. Study outcomes will be measured by blood collection; oral fluid sampling; oral x-ray and spine and hip bone density scan; routine periodontal examinations; and an oral health quality of life questionnaire.\n\nPatients of both genders and all ethnicities from age 30-75 years will be included in the study. All ethnicities are eligible for entry into study. No vulnerable populations will be included. Pregnant/breast-feeding women and women of childbearing potential on no contraception will be excluded from the study. Research records will not be linkable to the research subjects.

        "brief_summary": "This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Enzastaurin, an experimental drug that may prevent the growth of tumor vessels, in combination with Carboplatin, for patients who have a glioma, a type of brain tumor. Carboplatin is used for treating many kinds of cancers, though not recurrent gliomas. Tumor growth involves new cancer cell formation and accumulation, requiring a blood supply. Research shows that brain tumor cells can produce substances that stimulate new blood vessel formation. This study will look into whether the combination of drugs can stop that process.\n\nPatients ages 18 and older who have recurring gliomas, who are not pregnant or breast feeding, and who do not have serious diseases may be eligible for this study. About 96 patients will participate for 1 year. They will have a physical examination, give blood and urine samples for analysis, and undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scans regarding tumor growth, and perhaps an electrocardiogram. Patients may also undergo a dynamic MRI with spectroscopy or PET scan (positron emission tomography), to distinguish a live tumor from a dying one. Researchers are studying patients taking a certain type of antiseizure medicine and patients who are not taking it because some antiseizure medicines may change the way the body handles a drug such as Enzastaurin. There will be two groups of participants, with 16 to 48 each. Group A is not taking enzyme-inducing antiseizure drugs, and Group B is taking such drugs. In Groups A and B are four dose levels, with 4 to12 patients at each level. Patients' doctors will tell them which group they belong to and how much Enzastaurin and Carboplatin they will take. Treatment consists of Enzastaurin every day for 5 weeks in Cycle 1 only and for 4 weeks beginning with Cycle 2 (each 4-week period as a cycle). Patients take Enzastaurin within 30 minutes after a meal. History, physical, and neurological examinations are repeated at the end of Cycle 1 and then every 4 weeks. Patients will have a repeat head MRI or CT scan before each cycle. If they tolerate the drugs without serious side effects and the tumor is not growing, they may continue with another cycle of Enzastaurin, taking the tablets every day, and Carboplatin being infused on Day 8 of Cycle 1 and on Day 1 of each additional cycle. Routine lab tests are done regularly. Patients will continue the 4-week cycles of treatment for as long as they have no serious side effects and there are no signs of tumor growth. Side effects of Enzastaurin may be fatigue, constipation, cough, and nausea. In men, there may be a decrease in sperm count. Carboplatin can lead to low counts in blood cells and platelets, and there may also be an allergic reaction. Vomiting is a likely side effect. At injection sites, there may be redness, swelling, and pain.\n\nThis study may or may not have a direct benefit for participants. However, information gained may help the sponsor of the study, Eli Lilly and Company, and may help patients in the future who have gliomas.",

This study included a majority of cardiac surgery patients. Others studies have suggested that the beneficial effect of insulin-based tight perioperative glycemic control might be hampered by iatrogenic hypoglycemia. Moreover, insulin therapy failed to obtain perioperative glycemic stability in most patients.\n\nExenatide (Byetta \u00ae) is an incretin mimetic, characterized by an anti-hyperglycemic effect that depends on the blood glucose level.\n\nWe hypothesize that continuous intravenous infusion of exenatide could improve perioperative glycemic control and stability and could reduce the risk of iatrogenic hypoglycemia compared to a conventional insulin therapy during the perioperative period of cardiac surgery.",

The recommended treatment for advanced disease is a doublet platinum-based chemotherapy, although the survival benefits are modest. Even among those fit enough for chemotherapy, the response rate is only 20-40%, and median survival averages 9-10 months with the newer platinum-containing chemotherapy regimen (Schiller et al, 2002; Rudd et al, 2005; Lee et al, 2007). Only 11% of patients went on to survive 2 years when treated with the newer gemcitabine/carboplatin regimen established by the London Lung Cancer Group (Rudd et al, 2005; Lee et al, 2007).

The investigators propose to recruit up to 1000- patients with autoimmune conditions who have a completed 2-dose regime of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (\\>28 days prior) and who are planning to receive an additional dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (i.e., booster). Participants in this study will be men and women 18 years and older with confirmed rheumatic disease, including psoriatic arthritis (PsA), axial spondyloarthritis (SpA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who express a decision to receive the mRNA vaccination booster within 30 days post enrollment.\n\nA primary objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that holding certain medications for a brief period of time around the time of COVID-19 vaccination might improve the response to the vaccine while not unduly having safety concerns with respect to the effects of their disease. During the study, participants using the immunomodulatory therapies described outlined in protocol will be randomized to temporarily hold (for 2 weeks) versus continue after they receive the COVID-19 vaccine supplemental dose. Patients who temporarily stop one of their medications for their autoimmune inflammatory disease may be at increased risk of flares of their autoimmune condition. If these occur, they are expected to occur within 2 - 4 weeks of treatment interruption. Detailed protocol outlines the hold schedules for the therapies to be randomized in this study.",

        "brief_summary": "As stated by the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and the Socie\u0301te\u0301 Franc\u0327aise de Rhumatologie (SFR), treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) should target sustained remission or at least low disease activity. However, despite significant advances based on various combinations of conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and biologic DMARDs, RA therapies meet treatment goals only in some patients:\n\n* 40 to 50% of patients with early RA, treated with methotrexate (MTX) monotherapy as first-line therapy,\n* 20 to 30% of patients treated with a combination of MTX and biologic as second-line therapy.\n* Less than 10% of patients treated with a combination of MTX and another targeted DMARD, such as baricitinib, as third-line therapy.\n\nTherefore, new strategies targeted at achieving a higher percentage of remission are needed, that do not require waiting for multiple failed therapies. Combinations of biologics have shown synergistic improvement of symptoms in murine models of RA relative to the improvement observed with either agent alone. However, in RA patients, only five randomised clinical trials (RCTs) have explored the efficacy and safety of combining tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor with another biologic (anakinra, abatacept, rituximab or bimekizumab).\n\nBaricitinib is a selective, reversible and competitive inhibitor of Janus kinases (Jaki). This treatment is efficient in a number of therapeutic scenarios in RA and showed a clinical superiority over adalimumab in one RCT (RA-BEAM study in MTX inadequate responders). Of note, baricitinib inhibits many of the pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of RA but does not block signalling downstream of TNF. Owing to the interest in combining different mechanisms of action, the investigators plan to assess the efficacy and safety of combination therapy with baricitinib and a TNF inhibitor. The investigators are aware that combining targeted therapies is not recommended due to a potential increase in the frequency of serious adverse events. However, several case series on patients treated with a combination of targeted therapies have been published, suggesting a certain efficacy in patients with refractory RA. The first ones focused on inflammatory bowel diseases and psoriasis, but more recently, combination of tofacitinib (which belongs to the same Jaki family as baricitinib) with various biologics has been reported in a sample of RA patients. No serious adverse effects were reported over a mean of approximately 11 months of therapy. The clinical improvement was mild but noticeable in these refractory RA cases.\n\nRecently, data of interest from the RA-BEAM study have been reported. Patients who switched from adalimumab to baricitinib showed improvements in disease control. Because the switch from adalimumab to baricitinib occurred without a washout period, and because adalimumab has a mean circulating half-life of approximately 14 days, patients would have received several weeks of dual TNF and Jak1/Jak2 inhibition in the course of the change of treatment. The observation of increased efficacy, with no apparent acute safety issues during the weeks when patients were exposed to both adalimumab and baricitinib, is of interest, and supports our strategy to combine the two treatments for patients with refractory RA.\n\nThe investigators consider that there is a need for investigation into the addition of anti-TNF to baricitinib in patients suffering of refractory RA (inadequate response to TNF inhibitors). The investigators hypothesize that in this population, based on ACR50 score, this combination therapy will decrease disease activity more efficiently than a switch to another targeted DMARD, such as baricitinib.",

Of great concern, the majority of people with type 2 diabetes are sedentary and one possible reason may be that exercise, even at low levels, is perceived as being a harder effort than for nondiabetic people. Thus, treatments that may motivate patients with type 2 diabetes to be more physically active have great potential benefit.\n\nRecent observational studies suggest that glucagon-like peptide-1 agents, such as exenatide, may have a beneficial effect on endothelial and cardiac function. Because these two factors have been shown to be associated with exercise dysfunction in type 2 diabetes, the investigators hypothesize that exenatide may improve exercise capacity in those with type 2 diabetes. The aims of this study are to (1) assess whether exenatide will improve functional exercise capacity in persons with type 2 diabetes and (2) investigate the effect of exenatide on specific metabolic, endothelial, cardiac and peripheral circulatory measures of function related to changes in exercise capacity. The Investigators primary hypothesis is that exenatide will improve functional exercise capacity in people with type 2 diabetes. Having a drug that improves exercise capacity could motivate patients to exercise more and hence be a significant benefit.",

Latinos have cultural beliefs and behaviors specific to this population that should be appropriately addressed in a diabetes self-management education and support program. Diabetes Pueblo is a diabetes education program that may be a solution to help address the barriers Latinos with T2D have to diabetes care and insulin use. The Diabetes Pueblo program consists of two targeted diabetes education curriculums for the local Latino community: (a) Diabetes Fundamentals and (b) Insulin Success, a culturally appropriate program course addressing barriers to initiating and optimizing insulin and T2D therapies. We will explore if Diabetes Pueblo Program improves knowledge of lifestyle advice for healthy eating and physical activity, increase the propensity to use insulin when clinically indicated, and improve success rates with insulin therapy by addressing common fears and negative perceptions of T2D therapies in this population.",

Global deletion of mPGES-1 in mice suppresses prostaglandin (PG) E2 and augments PGI2 by PGH2 substrate rediversion. Unlike COX-2 inhibition or gene deletion, mPGES-1 deletion does not cause a predisposition to thrombogenesis and hypertension. However, cell-specific deletion of mPGES-1 reveals that the predominant substrate rediversion product among the prostaglandins varies by cell type, complicating drug development. The research team has developed an ultra performance liquid chromatography/ tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) technique that allows the quantification of a wide range of lipids beyond the prostaglandin pathway (leukotrienes, anandamide and the 2-arachidonylglycerol cascades).\n\nThis study is designed to examine different pathway interventions from the arachidonic acid cascade by anti-inflammatory compounds (with a focus on mPGES-1 inhibition) in whole human blood in vitro (Part A) and ex vivo (Part B). In Part B, healthy volunteers will be asked to take a single, therapeutic dose of celecoxib and blood and urine samples will be collected before and after drug administration. Collected blood will be stimulated ex vivo, and lipids and their metabolites will be measured in blood and urine, respectively. The investigators expect that lipid profile from ex vivo hWBA done on celecoxib-treated subjects will recapitulate findings from the in vitro hWBA received with celecoxib-treated human blood (Part A).",

The lack of ST-segment elevation resolution after angioplasty with stenting is a marker of microcirculatory dysfunction and is associated with a poor prognosis. Routine administration with primary stenting of the platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor Abciximab in acute myocardial infarction is still a matter of debate with conflicting results emerging from two major clinical studies ADMIRAL and CADILLAC. However, evidences are in favour of a benefit of this treatment especially when administrated early (in a pre-hospital manner) before percutaneous coronary intervention.Our primary purpose is to investigate the benefit of an early (i.e. pre-hospital) vs. a conventional (i.e. per-angiography) administration of Abciximab on ST-segment elevation regression at one hour after primary percutaneous angioplasty.",

To evaluate the association between empagliflozin use and mentioned outcomes routinely collected health information from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), the Hospital Episodes Statistics, and Office of National Statistic will be used. This PASS will be conducted through an observational cohort study among adult patients with T2DM and at least 12 months of continuous enrolment in the CPRD where new users of empagliflozin will be compared to new users of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitors.

Pemetrexed at 10 mg dose level on the schedule of 1-2 times per week was recommended as an intrathecal administration agent for patients with refractory leptomeningeal metastases from non-small-cell lung cancer in the previous study. Moreover, the maximum-tolerated dose and recommended dose of intrathecal pemetrexed in the previous study was obtained without vitamin supplementation. Vitamin supplementation has been shown to reduce pemetrexed-induced myelosuppression. In this study, the regimen of intrathecal pemetrexed with folic acid and vitamin B12 supplementation may provide higher safety. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate the maximally tolerated dose and evaluate the safety and effectiveness of intrathecal pemetrexed with vitamin supplementation as the first-line intrathecal chemotherapy in patients with leptomeningeal metastases from malignant solid tumors.",

Glofitamab and obinutuzumab are monoclonal antibodies that may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Obinutuzumab may also reduce the risk of immune-related conditions from treatment. Pirtobrutinib is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of the protein that signals cancer cells to multiply. Giving glofitamab in combination with pirtobrutinib may be safe, tolerable and/or effective in treating patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma.",

        "brief_summary": "Weight gain associated with antipsychotic medication use is a major side effect that limits the tolerability of these drugs. This often significant weight gain adversely affects health, increasing risks for developing cardiovascular disease, diabetes, sleep apnea, cancers of the colon, kidneys, uterus, endometrium and esophagus and osteoarthritis. Beasley and colleagues (1997) reported that 40.5% of olanzapine-treated patients gained more than 7% of baseline weight. Much of the olanzapine induced weight gain occurs early in treatment, and antipsychotic-na\u00efve and young patients (Woods et al., 2002) are particularly vulnerable to this side effect. One of the most promising medications to aid weight loss in patients taking olanzapine is amantadine.\n\nAttempts at preventing weight gain are expected to be more successful than attempts to reverse it once it occurs. It is now common clinical practice to educate all patients beginning treatment with olanzapine, and other antipsychotics, about healthy eating and the need for exercise. However, despite this effort, weight gain in this population continues. Beginning a weight-stabilizing medication after a low threshold of weight gain has occurred may have significant impact on patients' health and their willingness to continue to take antipsychotics.\n\nWe propose to investigate the efficacy of amantadine as a weight-stabilizing agent in a population of first-episode psychotic subjects just beginning treatment with antipsychotic agents. This population is generally young and medically healthy, without contraindications to amantadine. They are often of normal body mass index and without obesity-related medical problems. They have much to gain in preventing the weight gain which so often progresses steadily over the course of treatment, is difficult to reverse and results in significant morbidity and mortality. Additionally, the first episode psychotic population tends to take fewer concomitant psychiatric medications. This is important since these medications may cause weight gain (long term use of mirtazapine, lithium, depakote) or weight loss (short term use of SSRI's) which could confound the effectiveness of amantadine to combat weight gain.",

Pemetrexed has shown a broad array of activity in many diseases that until now were thought to be non-responsive to chemotherapy in the second-line setting.\n\nThis trial is designed to further assess the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and pharmacogenetics of pemetrexed as a single agent in subjects with HRPC whose disease has progressed following one prior taxane-based chemotherapy regimen for HRPC.",

Abemaciclib is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It is highly selective inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6, which are proteins involved in cell differentiation and growth. It works by blocking the action of an abnormal protein that signals cancer cells to multiply. Radioligand therapy uses a small molecule (in this case 177Lu-PSMA-617), which carries a radioactive component to destroys tumor cells. When 177Lu-PSMA-617 is injected into the body, it attaches to the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) receptor found on tumor cells. After 177Lu-PSMA-617 attaches to the PSMA receptor, its radiation component destroys the tumor cell. Giving abemaciclib before 177Lu-PSMA-617 may help 177Lu-PSMA-617 kill more tumor cells.",

        "brief_summary": "Obesity, affecting 40% of US adults and costing 173b annually, represents a significant health care burden (1). It is associated with increased risk for multiple chronic diseases including hypertension, type 2 diabetes (T2D), cardiovascular disease, and NAFLD, as well as cancer, osteoarthritis, and obstructive sleep apnea. The investigators plan to test the hypothesis that tirzepatide, a dual GLP/GIP agonist, improves metabolic health (insulin resistance and regional fat distribution and cardiovascular risk profile) not only by inducing weight loss via GLP1-agonism, but also via beneficial cellular and molecular changes in adipose tissue, given that GIP binds receptors in human fat cells. Based on studies in mice showing that GIP alone or tirzepitide treatment decreases inflammation, increases lipid buffering (fat storage in the fat cells instead of releasing it into the bloodstream), and improves glucose homeostasis. The investigators believe that the GIP component of tirzepatide will make fat cells healthier and reverse lipotoxicity, which is one of the mechanisms by which obesity leads to insulin resistance, disordered regional fat distribution, and type 2 diabetes. To date, the effect of dual GLP1 and GIP agonist treatment on adipose tissue has not been evaluated in humans. Given the existing but limited data, dual GIP/GLP-1 agonist treatment in obese humans with metabolic risk factors is an attractive pharmacologic candidate that would lead to both weight loss and healthier fat, potentially offering uniquely powerful synergistic clinical benefits. It is thus of tremendous importance to define the biological effects of dual-agonist treatment on human adipose tissue structure and function, as well as related improvements in regional fat distribution and systemic adipose and muscle insulin sensitivity. In this study, the investigators will randomize overweight (with risk factors) or obese nondiabetic individuals to hypocaloric diet or tirzepatide for 22 weeks with matched weight loss for the first 6 weeks. The investigators will quantify insulin resistance, fat and lean mass, including regional fat distribution, and changes in adipose tissue (needle biopsy from abdominal fat tissue) to see if tirzepatide effects differ from dietary weight loss.",

Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Chemotherapy drugs work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. This trial may help doctors find out if giving ramucirumab with pembrolizumab is more effective at treating patients with stage IV or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer than standard chemotherapy.",

A brain chemical called Substance P acts at places in the brain called NK1 receptors. Substance P is released in response to stress and gives rise to behaviors that are thought to represent anxiety. LY686017 blocks Substance P from acting at the NK1 receptors.\n\nPeople between 21 and 65 years of age who have been drinking on a regular basis for at least one month before entering the study, who meet the criteria for alcohol dependence and who have an elevated score on a general test of anxiety may be eligible for this study.\n\nParticipants are admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for 35 days. They participate in an alcohol treatment program in addition to the research study. After having been withdrawn from alcohol for at least 2 days, participants receive either 50 mg of LY686017 or placebo (an inactive substance that looks like the study drug) every morning for 28 days. In addition to drug treatment, they undergo the following procedures:\n\n* Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI): In the last week of the study, subjects undergo MRI to study the amount of blood going to brain structures thought to be involved in anxiety and craving. During the procedure, they look at pictures of faces exhibiting various emotions and pictures related to alcohol.\n* Cue reactivity: At the beginning and towards the end of the study, subjects are asked to rate their alcohol craving and their anxiety level while they sniff and handle their favorite alcoholic beverage or water.\n* Metyrapone test: During weeks 1 and 4 of the study, subjects are given metyrapone - a drug that interferes with the body's ability to make the stress hormone cortisol - to determine how LY686017 affects the body's hormonal response. The drop in cortisol from metyrapone administration causes the brain to release ACTH, a hormone that causes the adrenal gland to make cortisol.\n* Trier test: In the last week of the study, subjects give a 5-minute speech to three people and are then asked to subtract numbers in their head. Then they are asked to rate their feelings and desire for alcohol on two rating scales. Blood is drawn from a saline lock at the beginning and end of the test to measure hormone levels.\n* Rating scales: Subjects complete an Obsessive Drinking Scale weekly and an Alcohol Urge Questionnaire and Comprehensive Psychiatric Rating Scale twice a week.\n* Blood tests: Blood samples are collected periodically to check blood chemistries, clotting time, and the amount of LY686017 in the blood.",

Half of the subjects receive either Guideline Intervention (GI) or Enhanced Clinical Intervention (ECI). ECI is a combination of information and support, such as education about bipolar disorder, the medications used to treat it, information about sleep practices and habits that affect quality of sleep, review of symptoms, medication side effects, and coping with side effects. It is predicted that Enhanced Clinical Intervention will be more effective in reducing the differences in results between those most at risk compared to mid-life Caucasians.

Most insulin treated patients with type 2 diabetes take U100 insulin, but if they require large doses (such as \\>150 units a day) they may experience pain at this site of injection and the absorption of the insulin is unpredictable, thereby leading to poor glucose control. To overcome these problems, doctors sometimes switch to a more concentrated form of insulin called U500 insulin. U500 is five times as concentrated as U100 insulin and therefore delivers an equivalent dose of insulin in much lesser volume. However, how to best use U-500 insulin is not certain. The investigators are not really sure how long a given dose is effective in patients who require large doses (\\>150 units of U100 insulin), so are not sure of how often the drug should be administered. In this study, the investigators will determine how effective two different doses of U-500 regular insulin (100 U and 200 U) are in lowering blood sugar and how long these two doses last. This information will help doctors develop better treatment plans for patients with type 2 diabetes.",

Part II is designed to obtain proof of principle of the galunisertib plus capecitabine combination in patients with chemo-resistant CRC. The combination of galunisertib plus capecitabine will be given as second line therapy in the phase II part of this study.\n\nPatients with chemotherapy resistant activated TGF-\u03b2 signature-like tumors will have received a fluoropyrimidine (5FU or capecitabine) in the first line of chemotherapy, usually combined with oxaliplatin and, depending upon local hospital preferences or national guidelines, also bevacizumab, or cetuximab/panitumumab if the tumor is KRAS wild type. Addition of galunisertib to capecitabine should thus result in reversal of unresponsiveness, which is the first step in exploring this concept in the clinic. Capecitabine can be used as single agent in advanced CRC and is thus attractive for this study concept. If proof of principle is achieved also other tumor types can be explored with this genetic makeup, such as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in second line of treatment after platinum doublet therapy in first line, usually cisplatin/carboplatin-pemetrexed in non-squamous and cisplatin/carboplatin-gemcitabine or cisplatin/carboplatin-paclitaxel in squamous type NSCLC.",

Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of non-small cell lung cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Erlotinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving combination chemotherapy together with bevacizumab, radiation therapy, and erlotinib may kill more tumor cells.\n\nPURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of bevacizumab and erlotinib when given together with combination chemotherapy and radiation therapy and to see how well they work in treating patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer.",

AD is thought to be caused by an excess of A-Beta amyloid, a sticky protein in the brain that forms amyloid plaques. Treatments that slow the synthesis or deposition of A-Beta amyloid, or that increase clearance, might be expected to slow the progression of AD.\n\nLY2062430 (solanezumab) is a humanized anti-A Beta peptide immunoglobulin G-1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody being developed for the treatment of AD. The primary hypothesis being tested is that LY2062430 will slow cognitive and functional decline in AD as compared with placebo. Each patient's participation will last approximately 19 months. Patients taking approved AD medications may participate in this study and continue taking these medications during the study.",

According to the pivotal studies (MONARCH 2, 3 and MONARCH plus), the most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) generally reported occurred at an early time (within 28 days after treatment initiation) point during treatment (Dickler et al. 2017); hence, each patient enrolled in the study will have the first follow-up visit at 4 \u00b1 1 weeks after the first abemaciclib treatment for regular safety monitoring. Since most reported TEAEs occur within 6 months, patients will return to the clinic after receiving Verzenios for 6 months to carry out the routine effectiveness evaluation in the normal clinical practice setting. The observational duration for primary objective is set as 24 \u00b1 4 weeks. Moreover, the effectiveness related variables including ORR, DCR, EFS rate, and OS rate, if available, will be investigated as the secondary objectives of the study and patients will be followed for 24 \u00b1 4 weeks and up to 2 years (only for EFS rate and OS rate) after initiation of Verzenios. Approximately 30 hospitals across China are planned for participation in this study. This study plans to enroll approximately 1500 patients (detailed in Section 9.5) and both safety and effectiveness of Verzenios will be evaluated. The observation period for each patient will be either until the last Verzenios treatment (if patients discontinue Verzenios before the follow-up duration of 24 weeks for safety and effectiveness \\[EFS rate and OS rate will be assessed at 52 weeks and 104 weeks\\], 30 days follow-up will be carried out for safety events), or follow-up discontinuation (for example, death), whichever comes first. Visits will be performed at baseline (baseline visit), 4 weeks (Visit 1), 12 weeks (Visit 2), and 24 weeks (Visit 3) of treatment for safety and effectiveness assessments. Follow-up visits will be performed at 52 weeks (Visit 4) and 104 weeks (Visit 5) of treatment for OS rate assessment.",

        "brief_summary": "Optimal management of patients with advanced NSCLC and with PS 2 remains controversial and underrepresented in clinical trials, typically accounting for 5 to 10% of enrolled patients. Patient PS 2 proportion in population-based studies is considerably higher than that included in clinical trials. Management of patients with PS of 2 in clinical practice is empirical and inconsistent. Patients have median overall survival of 3 to 5 months in randomized trials, and treatment options include best supportive care, single-agent and combination chemotherapy. Retrospective studies have suggested that patients PS 2 may benefit from first-line chemotherapy in terms of symptom improvement and overall survival. In many of these studies, single-agent chemotherapy was compared with best supportive care alone. Data on the role of cisplatin-based combinations for patients with PS 2 is more scant, with one study questioning its benefit, and another interrupting accrual because of undue toxicity. With regards to carboplatin, the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) study 9730 compared paclitaxel plus carboplatin versus paclitaxel alone in a subgroup of 107 patients with PS 2; the median overall survival was significantly longer in group treated with combination chemotherapy (4.7 versus 2.4 months). Combination chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel also produced a statistically significantly higher incidence of severe hematological and non-hematological toxicities. On the basis of aforementioned results, a recent European panel stated that carboplatin-based or low-dose cisplatin-based doublets might represent alternative options to single-agent chemoterapy in patients PS 2. Outside clinical trials, single-agent chemotherapy with a 3rd generation agent remains valid option for patients PS2. Results demonstrate that pemetrexed is an agent with established single-agent activity in NSCLC, and suggest it is a potential candidate for combinations with platinum and other agents currently utilized for patients with advanced NSCLC. Favorable toxicity profile of pemetrexed suggests that this agent is an ideal candidate for single agent testing and in combination among patients with PS 2. Substantial doubt remains in the comparative benefit from monotherapy versus combination. Starting dose and schedule of pemetrexed were set for this study based on its current labeling in the 2nd line treatment of metastatic NSCLC and 1st line treatment of malignant pleural mesothelioma.",

Radioactive drugs, such as 177-Lutetium-PSMA, may carry radiation directly to tumor cells and not harm normal cells. SBRT uses special equipment to position a patient and deliver radiation to tumors with high precision. This method may kill tumor cells with fewer doses over a shorter period and cause less damage to normal tissue. Giving 177-Lutetium-PSMA before SBRT may make the SBRT more effective.",

        "brief_summary": "Objective\n\nIonotropic glutamate receptors are ligand-gated ion channels responsible for most of the excitatory neurotransmission in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS). Based on pharmacology, they have been grouped into three subtypes-NMDA, AMPA and kainate. In recent years it has become apparent that the receptors do not function alone, but in the company of auxiliary proteins that regulate their activity \\[1\\]. Some of these have been shown to modulate AMPA receptor trafficking, gating and pharmacology and are classified as transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory proteins, or TARPs ( \\>=-2, \\>=-3, \\>=-4, \\>=-5, \\>=-7, and \\>=-8). Genetic data indicate a possible role of TARPs in schizophrenia, depression, epilepsy, neuropathic pain, and bipolar disorder \\[1\\]. In a preclinical collaboration with Eli Lilly, we developed a promising radioligand, 18F-TARP252 to image TARP \\>=-8 using positron emission tomography (PET).\n\nThis protocol covers three phases:\n\n* Phase 1: kinetic brain imaging to quantify TARP \\>=-8 in brain relative to concurrent measurement of the parent radioligand in arterial plasma;\n* Phase 2: if 18F-TARP252 is successful in Phase 1, we will estimate the radiation-absorbed doses by performing whole body imaging;\n* Phase 3: test-retest analysis of brain binding relative to concurrent measurement of the parent radioligand in arterial plasma.\n\nStudy Population\n\nHealthy adult female and male volunteers (n=22, ages 18 - 55) will undergo brain imaging. An additional eight healthy volunteers will undergo whole body dosimetry analysis.\n\nDesign\n\nFor quantification of TARP \\>=-8, 22 healthy controls will have brain PET imaging using 18F-TARP252 and an arterial line. Some of them will have a test-retest scan. Eight additional subjects will have a whole body PET scan for dosimetry. For dosimetry, no arterial line will be used.\n\nOutcome Measures\n\nTo assess quantitation of TARP \\>=-8 with 18F-TARP252, we will primarily use two outcome measures: the identifiability and time stability of distribution volume calculated with compartmental modeling. In test-retest study, we will calculate the retest variability. We will assess whole-body biodistribution and dosimetry of 18F-TARP252 by calculating doses to organs and effective dose to the body.",

Global deletion of mPGES-1 in mice suppresses PGE2 and augments PGI2 by PGH2 substrate rediversion. Unlike COX-2 inhibition or gene deletion, mPGES-1 deletion does not cause a predisposition to thrombogenesis and hypertension. However, cell-specific deletion of mPGES-1 reveals that the predominant substrate rediversion product amongst the prostaglandins varies by cell type, complicating drug development. We have developed an ultra performance liquid chromatography/ tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) technique that allows the quantification of a wide range of lipids beyond the prostaglandin pathway (leukotrienes, anandamide and the 2-arachidonylglycerol cascades).\n\nThis study is designed to examine different pathway interventions from the arachidonic acid cascade by anti-inflammatory compounds (with a focus on mPGES-1 inhibition) in whole human blood in vitro (Part A) and ex vivo (Part B). In Part A, whole human blood will be donated by healthy volunteers and treated with screening compounds in vitro (outside of the body). Experiments will be performed to measure an array of lipids in plasma and serum from pre-stimulated whole blood treated with a single or a combination of the test compounds.\n\nThis study may reveal pathways previously unknown to be affected by the existing anti-inflammatory drugs and drug candidates, and will possibly suggest new indications and/or side effects.",

Tepotinib is used in patients whose cancer has a mutated (changed) form of a gene called MET. It is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of the abnormal MET protein that signals tumor cells to multiply. This helps slow or stop the spread of tumor cells.

Criteria for diagnosis have been adopted by the Barany Society. Previous epidemiological research from the investigators has shown that VM affects 2.7% of the adult population of the United States. Yet, despite its high prevalence, there is very little data upon which to guide treatment decisions. A Cochrane review in 2015 concluded that there were no placebo controlled trials in VM, and none have been done since then. The investigators recently developed and validated a patient reported outcome tool for VM called VM-PATHI (VM- Patient Assessment Tool and Handicap Inventory). Anecdotal evidence suggests that CGRP antagonists, such as Galcanezumab, may be effective in reducing or eliminating symptoms in VM. Therefore, the investigators propose a pilot study of changes in VM-PATHI scores, comparing active treatment (Galcanezumab) to placebo arms.",

A recent epidemiological study showed that patients with T1D have a two-fold CV mortality risk, even in case of good glycemic control. In addition, it has been shown that patients with T1D with no traditional CV risk factors had about a 80% higher risk of cardiovascular event compared to non-diabetic individuals. This indicates that further modifiable risk factors in relation to CV mortality remain to be identified.\n\nOne of the candidates that could help to disentangle the factors associated with the increased CV mortality in T1D patients is glycemic variability which could contribute to diabetes complications. Indeed, severe hypoglycaemia, one of the most severe consequence of glycaemic variability, are associated with a higher mortality in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.\n\nIn order to evaluate the relation between glycemic variability, insulin therapy modalities and CV risk as well as some other questions related to health determinants of T1D, we are building up a large observational, prospective, multi-centric cohort study of patients gathering 15,000 patients with T1D, age above 6 years old, to perform the following:\n\n* Collecting clinical information\n* Evaluating Glycemic variability (assessed by the coefficient of variation of glucose (CV) calculated from automatically downloaded continuous glucose monitoring data (CGM)\n* Biobanking including plasma, DNA, urine, saliva and hair.\n* Collecting patients' reported outcomes through auto-questionnaires (online questionnaires).\n* Doing an active follow-up for a period of 10 years with an intermediate visit every 3 years.\n* Passive follow-up: link to national Health data system (Syst\u00e8me National de Donn\u00e9es de Sant\u00e9, SNDS) in order to exhaustively collect health events as death, CV events and hospitalizations (including severe hypoglycemia).",

In the elderly, dysthymic disorder (DD) has been shown to be associated with suffering and disability. The differences between young adult and elderly DD patients indicate that findings obtained in young adults with DD cannot be extrapolated to elderly DD patients who need to be studied separately. Data from epidemiologic studies support this view. In contrast to the data in young adult DD patients, there is a paucity of controlled data on the treatment of elderly DD patients. In our center, a double-masked, placebo-controlled study of 91 elderly DD patients did not find significant superiority for fluoxetine over placebo with response rates of 27.3% for fluoxetine and 19.6% for placebo in intent-to-treat analyses, and response rates of 37.5% for fluoxetine and 23.1% for placebo in completer analyses. Given the relative failure of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRIs) to treat geriatric DD effectively, the investigators decided to evaluate the dual reuptake inhibitor, venlafaxine.\n\nThe investigators earlier completed an investigator-initiated, open-label 12-week venlafaxine (Effexor XR) trial. Of 23 elderly DD patients, 18 completed the trial. Fourteen (60.9%) were responders in intent-to-treat analyses with the last observation carried forward, and 77.8% were responders in completer analyses. Nearly half the sample (47.8%) met criteria for remission. In the intent-to-treat sample, increased severity of depression at baseline was associated with superior response and the presence of cardiovascular disease was associated with poorer response. These results with venlafaxine indicate that further treatment studies of dual serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors like duloxetine are warranted in elderly patients with dysthymic disorder.",

Cetuximab can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Radiation Therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue . Giving the drug Cetuximab together with Radiation Therapy may kill more tumor cells. Surgery is the most common treatment for Colorectal Cancer to remove the tumor, as well as a small margin of surrounding normal tissue and possibly nearby lymph nodes. Surgery is usually used in conjunction with other conventional treatments such as Radiation Therapy. Radiation Therapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed. Radiation Therapy after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery.\n\nScreening test such as Fecal Occult Blood Test (FOBT) and Colonoscopy has to be done. Tumor markers for Colorectal Carcinoma are Carcinoembryonic antigen (CAE) and CA 19-9 and to assess the response of tumor markers Carcinoembryonic antigen (CAE) and CA 19-9 will be used and periodically Colonoscopy has to be done. Colorectal Cancer Surgery are Colon resection (Colectomy), Rectum resection (Proctectomy), Colostomy, and Radiofrequency ablation.\n\nPURPOSE: Determine the tumor response rate treated with Cetuximab and Radiation Therapy Vs Surgery before or after Radiation Therapy in patients with Colorectal Cancer from stage II to IV",

One option is teriparatide, an osteoporosis medication that can build new bone. Investigators will conduct a double blind randomized placebo controlled trial to examine whether teriparatide use in AFF patients with an incomplete break will help accelerate fracture healing and prevent surgical intervention. Co-primary outcomes include change in WOMAC scores from baseline to 12 months and number of participants requiring surgical intervention at 12 months. Investigators will recruit 60 women and men over the age of 30 who have experienced an incomplete AFF. Participants will be randomly assigned to either teriparatide (20 mcg/day) or placebo (using an identical injection pen) for up to 2 years. As AFFs are highly debilitating, a trial examining the use of Teriparatide in this population is urgently needed.",

        "brief_summary": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a fatal degenerative disease of the brain for which there is no cure. AD causes brain cells to die. AD is thought to be caused by an excess of beta amyloid (\u03b2-amyloid), a sticky protein in the brain that forms amyloid plaques. At autopsy, AD patients are required to have these amyloid plaques in the brain in order to have a definitive diagnosis of AD. Inhibiting the enzyme gamma-secretase (\u03b3-secretase) lowers the production of \u03b2-amyloid. Semagacestat (LY450139) is a functional \u03b3-secretase inhibitor and was shown to lower \u03b2-amyloid in blood and spinal fluid in humans tested thus far and in blood, spinal fluid and brain in animals tested thus far. This study used several different tests to measure the effect of semagacestat on both \u03b2-amyloid and amyloid plaques for some patients. The buildup of amyloid plaques was measured by a brain scan that takes a picture of amyloid plaques in the brain. Other tests measured the overall function of the brain and brain size in some patients. In this trial, patients who initially received placebo (inactive sugar pill) were, at a certain point in the study, switched over to active drug, semagacestat. In other words, all patients could eventually receive active drug. Each patient's participation could last approximately 2 years. Patients taking approved AD medications were permitted to participate in this study and continue taking these medications during the study. All patients who completed this study had the option to continue receiving semagacestat by participating in an open label study.\n\nPreliminary results from this study (LFBC) (and another similar study LFAN \\[NCT00594568\\]) showed semagacestat did not slow disease progression and was associated with worsening of clinical measures of cognition and the ability to perform activities of daily living. Study drug was stopped in all studies. LFBC, LFAN and open label LFBF (NCT01035138) have been amended to continue collecting safety data, including cognitive scores, for at least seven months.

        "brief_summary": "This study will investigate the effects on bone quality of a medication (Teriparatide) used to treat people with severe osteoporosis. Teriparatide is the only bone formation therapy that has been approved for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis in Canada. Osteoporosis is currently diagnosed using a bone mineral density (BMD) scan, which measures the amount of mineral (calcium etc) in bones (the higher the amount of mineral, the lower the fracture risk). Although BMD is linked to bone strength and is used to measure fracture risk, it does not give information on bone structure (called bone geometry) which can also tell us a great deal about fracture risks. Clinical trials have shown that teriparatide increases BMD at the lumbar spine and total hip, while BMD at the forearm decreases after 20 months of therapy. Whether this decrease of BMD at the forearm suggests a higher risk of wrist fracture or a change in bone structure is unclear. Bone biopsies of the pelvis done on people taking teriparatide shows improvement of bone geometry (ie bone thickness and increased trabeculae (small interconnecting rods of bone), suggesting that a change in bone geometry at the wrist may be occurring as well. Currently, there is a new technology, high resolution pQCT (HR-pQCT) that can assess bone geometry without a biopsy. Since bone strength is affected both by BMD and bone structure (as well as other material properties), our group is interested in examining changes in bone geometry at the forearm (a non-weight bearing site) and ankle (a weight bearing site) in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis who receive 24 months of teriparatide therapy. The investigators believe that this new approach of measuring bone strength will help us better understand whether teriparatide has different effects at different bone sites.",

        "brief_summary": "Results of recent studies using standard long and short acting insulin therapy (Basal - Bolus or BBI) in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have not shown benefits to lower risks for heart attacks, strokes, or eye, nerve and kidney problems. Some studies also show a long time between the start of treatment and signs of benefit. This has led to a review of current ways to normalize blood glucose control with basal bolus insulin and how to make blood glucose better. Improving blood sugar with insulin therapy usually causes weight gain, more high sugar levels after meals, and more low blood sugars. Early studies suggest that when people take long-acting insulin and metformin, they have fewer blood sugar extremes when they also take a new type of medicine called glucagon-like polypeptide-1 (GLP-1) agonist named exenatide (Byetta), instead of meal-time insulin. This means there might be a better way to treat Type 2 diabetes.\n\nParticipants are asked to take part in an eight month study to find out if middle-aged and older people with Type 2 diabetes who have added risk factors for heart disease can even out their blood sugar levels. They will start on long-acting insulin, mealtime insulin, and metformin, if they are not already on these medications. Their kidney function tests must be normal and they must not be allergic to metformin. Then, after a 2 month run-in phase, they must be willing to be assigned by chance into one of two groups. This means that they will have a 50/50 chance (like flipping a coin) of being in either group. Half of them will be started on the new medicine known as Byetta rather than the meal-time insulin and the other half will remain on the meal-time insulin during the next 6 months (26 weeks) to see which group has more steady blood sugars. They will be asked to use a continuous blood sugar monitoring system called DexCom. A sensor is inserted under the skin in the same areas the insulin is injected. The DexCom can check their blood sugars 24 hours of the day and night and will be worn until 7 days of recordings are collected. In the same 7 day period, they will also be asked to wear a Holter or Telemetry monitor that will record their heart beats and rhythm which will be compared to the blood sugar readings. They will also use home glucose meters to check their glucose levels about 3 to 4 times a day. The study will take place at 12 centers in the United States and enroll about 120-130 people.",

The specific hypotheses to be tested are to determine if LY500307 is safe and well tolerated in this population and whether it elicits a sufficient efficacy signal to be advanced for further testing in schizophrenia. A two-stage Phase 1b/Phase 2a adaptive (\"drop the inferior dose\") experimental design is ongoing that combines three studies (clinical dose optimization, cortical target engagement confirmation and efficacy and safety assessment) into a single clinical trial.\n\nStage 1 was conducted in year 1 and Stage 2 will be conducted in years 2 and 3. The goal of Stage 1 was to identify and advance the highest dose that did not demonstrate a safety signal and had target selectivity as determined by lack of TT suppression. This criteria was fulfilled at both doses, the larger of the two (75 mg/day dose) was advanced to Stage 2. Furthermore, there was no suggestion of ER\u03b1 receptor activation (i.e., no pattern of TT decreases or feminization AEs) at either dose (25 mg/day and 75 mg/day). A third arm of 150 mg/day was added to Stage 2 for evaluation. Stage 2 results in the following three arms: placebo, 75 mg/day and 150 mg/day. The goals of Stage 2 are to further assess LY500307 doses for safety and target selectivity, confirm cortical target engagement and assess efficacy.\n\nPrimary Aim 1: To determine if LY500307 demonstrates cortical target engagement as assessed by fMRI/N-back in frontal-parietal regions. Secondary measures of target engagement are fMRI episodic memory, Pseudo-Continuous Arterial Spin Labeling, Mismatch Negativity/evoked response potentials, Auditory Steady State Response, Auditory P300 and Quantitative EEG (QEEG).\n\nPrimary Aim 2: To determine if LY500307 is superior to placebo for one or more of the primary efficacy endpoints: negative symptoms (Negative Symptom Assessment Scale - 16-item total score), working memory (the composite score for the Letter Number Sequencing and Spatial Span tests) and verbal memory (Hopkins Verbal Learning Test).\n\nPrimary Aim 3: To determine if LY500307 reduces total testosterone (TT) plasma concentrations, which is indicative of loss of selectivity for ER\u03b2 and engagement of ER\u03b1, using the following criteria: Decrease in TT plasma concentrations of 50% from baseline in 50% of subjects per arm treated for two consecutive post-randomization values with LY500307 in Stage 1 and Stage 2 of the trial.\n\nPrimary Aim 4: To assess the safety of LY500307 by determining if there are SAEs, AEs \"probably related to study drug,\" QTc prolongation, TT suppression (50% reduction from baseline) and to evaluate for other safety signals.",

It is expected that participants who enter at the very beginning of the enrolment period may be in the study for over 3 years, while participants who enter near the end of the enrolment period may be in the study for less than 2 years. The participants are put into 2 groups. It is decided by chance who gets into which group. One group gets empagliflozin tablets every day and the other group gets placebo tablets every day. Placebo tablets look like empagliflozin tablets but contain no medicine.\n\nParticipants visit the doctors regularly.

A decrease in Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) has been reported in pooled Exenatide/Placebo and Liraglutide/Placebo studies. More recently, LEAN study has shown that Liraglutide will result in improvements in liver histology in patients with NASH. It should be of high interest to investigate the effect of another GLP-1 Agonist as effective as Liraglutide, i.e. Dulaglutide in NASH.\n\nDulaglutide is one of the five GLP-1 receptor agonists approved for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). It is an effective treatment because it is dosed once-weekly, provides HbA1c reduction similar to Liraglutide, weight reduction similar to Exenatide, and has an adverse effect profile similar to other GLP-1 receptor agonists. Reduction in body weight was observed in patients treated with Dulaglutide, irrespective of nausea and/or vomiting.The search for a direct effect of Dulaglutide on liver fat overload in patients with type2 diabetes is required before considering the effectiveness of this treatment in NASH in diabetic populations. No current GLP-1 study has been designed with a control group with the same weight loss than as in the treatment group.\n\nPrimary objective: The investigators aim to study the effect of Dulaglutide 1.5 mg (TRULICITY\u00ae) add-on to dietary reinforcement after 52 weeks of treatment, on the improvement of liver histology compared to dietary reinforcement alone in patients with type 2 diabetes and carriers of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.\n\nSecondary objectives:\n\n* After 52 weeks of treatment, to assess the effect of dulaglutide (TRULICITY\u00ae) add-on to dietary reinforcement on Fibrosis score, Transaminase levels, body composition as measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, lipid profile, glycemic control and weight. The effect of the treatment will also be assessed on quality of life.\n* At 24 weeks after completion of the treatment, to assess the sustainability of dulaglutide (TRULICITY\u00ae) treatment add-on to dietary reinforcement on ALT and AST rates as well as on weight.",
