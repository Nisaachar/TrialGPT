The patient's symptoms, such as high fever, conjunctivitis, strawberry tongue, inflammation of the hands and feet, desquamation of the skin of the fingers and toes, and cervical lymphadenopathy, as well as the echocardiogram results, align with the inclusion criteria of the trial. Therefore, the patient is highly relevant to the clinical trial.",

The patient is not excluded by any of the exclusion criteria, as his symptoms fit the Kawasaki Disease criteria, his fever duration is within the acceptable range, and there is no information suggesting that he has received IVIG treatment at another hospital, has been treated with corticosteroids in the previous 2 weeks, has a disease that mimics Kawasaki Disease, has a previous diagnosis of Kawasaki Disease, or is unable to take aspirin. However, there is not enough information to determine whether the patient meets the inclusion criterion of having dysmorphous skin rashes or the exclusion criterion of incomplete collection of each followed-up data.",
